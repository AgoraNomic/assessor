ID: 9049
Title: Registration restrictions
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Aris, ais523


Amend Rule 869 by, as a single amendment (in order):

* Replacing the text "No person can be a player if e is part of another
player or another player is part of em." with "Rules to the contrary
notwithstanding, two or more persons CANNOT become Registered
simultaneously.".

* Inserting the following paragraph after the paragraph beginning "An
Unregistered person CAN":

{

The basis of a person is the set of all persons that are (recursively)
part of em, in addition to emself. Rules to the contrary
notwithstanding, a person CANNOT become Registered if eir basis overlaps
with that of any current player.

}


[

This fixes a bug where two group persons [A B] and [B C] could be both
be players, since neither is a part of the other.

In order to let this work, this also prohibits simultaneous
registrations. This is done now because simultaneous registrations would
break the check for overlapping persons (if [A B] and [B C] could
register simultaneously, neither would overlap with any existing player,
even if they overlapped with each other). As a more general matter,
simultaneous registrations seem likely to result in bugs, and
registration order has been used as a tiebreak before (e.g. for Spaaace).

Title: Self-ratification limitations
Adoption index: 3.0

Amend Rule 2201 ("Self-Ratification") by, as a single amendment (in order):

* Replacing "When a public document is continuously undoubted for one
week after publication" with "When a public document published less than
180 days ago is first continuously undoubted for one week after publication"

* Replacing the text "identifying a document and explaining" with
"identifying a public document published less than 180 days ago and
explaining".

[First, prevent self-ratifying documents from ratifying more than once
if they go from undoubted to doubted to undoubted. Next, add a
(generous) time limit on self-ratification and doubts to prevent very
old documents from surprisingly being ratified or imposing a requirement
on their publishers to respond. Also, only allow claims of error on
published documents (which later parts of the rule assume anyway).]


Amend Rule 2201 ("Self-Ratification") by, as a single amendment (in order):

* Inserting the following paragraph before the paragraph beginning "Any
person CAN": "The definition of documents as self-ratifying and the
definition of documents as self-ratifying attestations are secured at
power 3."

* Appending the following paragraph to the Rule:

{

The issuance of a doubt on a documents, the denial of a claim of error,
and the ceasing of a doubt on a document to be a doubt are secured at
power 3.

}

[Prevent low-power dictatorships from making random things
self-ratifying and from automatically making or denying claims of error.
All self-ratifying things (assets, Proposal Pool, switches, Festivity,
decision initiation/termination) are already defined at power >= 3.]
