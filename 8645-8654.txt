The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8645
Title: Some RTRW Clean-Ups
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: ATMunn
Co-authors: nix


Amend R2464 by replacing "set of regulations," with "a set of
regulations,".

Amend R2493 by:

      * replacing "an textual entity" with "a textual entity"; and
      * replacing "an person" with "a person".

Amend R2495 by replacing "This title" with "These regulations".

Amend R2471 by replacing "be not to be true" with "be not true".

Amend R2602 by removing any quotation marks and replacing "or e
corresponding" with "or the corresponding".

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8646
Title: Deputisation rewrite
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: G., ais523


Amend Rule 2160 ("Deputisation") by replacing the sole list with the
following:
{
  1. the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of holding
  that office, to perform the action (this requirement is fulfilled by the
  deputy performing the action); and, it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy
  to perform the action, other than by deputisation, if e held the office;
  and, the deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is doing
  so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation; and, the deputy has not
  held the office in the past 7 days; and,

  2. any of the following are true:
     (A) the office is vacant;
     (B) a time limit by which the rules require the action to be
         performed has expired, the office's holder has not changed
         in the past 7 days, and any of the following are true:

           (i) the deputy announced between two and fourteen days earlier
               that e intended to deputise for that office for the purposes
               of the particular action;
          (ii) the time limit expired between 14 days ago and 28 days ago;
         (iii) the time limit expired more than 28 days ago and the
               deputisation is temporary;
}

[This simplifies the list significantly, hopefully making it clearer. It
also makes the following substantive changes: allows only temporarily
deputisation (or deputisation with notice) for old duties, prohibits
deputies who have held the office in the past 7 days, and prohibits
deputising for an office whose holder has changed in the past 7 days, to
allow a holder time to catch up when they assume a new office, and to
prevent rapid-fire changes resulting from deputisation fights.]

ID: 8648
Title: Scoring Integer Points
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: snail
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2657 (Scoring) by replacing "add to that player's score the
associated amount of points" with "add to that player's score the floor of
the associated amount of points".

(This would let players score points for proposals with non-integer AIs.)

Repeal Rule 2602 (Glitter).

Title: Temporal Incursion Modification and Exclusion Act
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Aris, Oerjan


Amend Rule 1551 (Ratification) to read, in whole:

{

  A retroactive change is one that changes the game's record of past
  events. Retroactive changes are secured with power threshold 3.

  When a document or statement (hereafter "document") is to be ratified,
  the following definitions apply:
  * The publication time is the instant at which the document to be
    ratified was published.
  * The truth time is the instant at which the document specifies that it
    was true, or the publication time if such an instant is not specified.
  * The application time is the instant at which the document to be
    ratified is ratified.

  Ratification CANNOT occur if the truth time would be after the
  application time, or if the publication time would be after the
  application time.

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, when a document is ratified, the
  gamestate is modified to what it would be if, at the truth time, the
  gamestate had been minimally modified to make the ratified document as
  true and accurate as possible.

  Ratification CANNOT occur if it would add inconsistencies between the
  gamestate and the rules.

  Ratification CANNOT occur if the required modification to the gamestate
  is not possible or if multiple substantially distinct possible
  modifications would be equally appropriate.

  If the minimal modification would include past or present rule changes,
  they are instead excluded unless the ratified document explicitly and
  unambiguously recites either the changes or the resulting properties of
  the rule(s).

  An internally inconsistent document generally CANNOT be ratified;
  however, if such a document can be divided into a summary section and a
  main section, where the only purpose of the summary section is to
  summarize information in the main section, and the main section is
  internally consistent, ratification of the document proceeds as if it
  contained only the main section.

  Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g. a
  report's date of last ratification) is excluded from ratification. The
  rules may define additional information that is considered to be part of
  the document for the purposes of ratification; such definitions are
  secured with power threshold 3.

  Ratification is secured with power threshold 3.

}


[This is mostly intended to be a clarification; it shouldn't change how
ratification is supposed to work, except that it explicitly excludes
silent rule changes from the modification (it's currently ambiguous
whether they're excluded or make the whole ratification fail). This also
secures all retroactive changes, where retroactive changes are defined
as altering the game's record of the past. This mirrors the way that
Falsifian found ratification works in eir law thesis.]

Title: Device Reconstruction
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: ais523
Co-authors: 


In rule 2654, replace:
{{{
    * If a Device has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to
      judge that Device CAN assign it to emself without 3
      objections.
    * The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which
      e feels may be helpful in the use of the Device in the FLR.
    * Then, the Device changes, following which each active player
      gains 1 card of each type and eir grant (if any).
}}}
with
{{{
    * If a Device has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to

    * The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which

  e feels may be helpful in the use of the Device in the FLR.
}}}
[The current version of the rule makes drastic changes to the economy
on a very vaguely defined trigger (possibly dependent on the
Rulekeepor's mental state) which might potentially be set off without
us realising it. This reorders the sections of the rule to make the
trigger something that we have more control over - this is the order I
had in mind when trying to construct the Device originally.]

[
- clarifies timing of JC grant paragraph
- the default penalty is 2 blots.  a set-complete JC removes 2.5
  blots.  A perp shouldn't profit from their crime by pointing
  at themselves and getting a JC for it.  So this removes self-points
  from the counting.
]

Amend Rule 2478 (Vigilante Justice) by replacing:
  The player who initiated the most Finger Pointings that resulted
  in a Warning, Indictment, or Cold Hand of Justice in the previous
  Agoran Week CAN once grant emself a Justice Card by announcement.
with:
  The player who initiated the most Finger Pointings at other
  players that, in the previous Agoran Week, resulted
  in a Warning, Indictment, or Cold Hand of Justice, CAN once
  grant emself a Justice Card by announcement.
