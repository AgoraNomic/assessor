ID: 9276
Title: CFJ Number Card Fix
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: ais523
Co-authors: Janet


If exactly one rule contains the text
{{{
Whenever a player scores a number as described in this rule, the
Numerator CAN once, and SHALL in a timely manner, grant its author
}}}
then amend that rule by replacing that text with
{{{
Whenever a player scores a number as described in this rule, the
Numerator CAN once, and SHALL in a timely manner, grant that player
}}}
[This is a fix-forward for text in a rule proposed in a proposal that
has not yet been adopted, written so as to not care about what number
the rule eventually ends up being given.]

ID: 9282
Title: Initiation specification
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: ais523


Amend Rule 107 by:

* Replacing "The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
period for the decision." with "The initiation of an Agoran decision
also initiates the voting period for that decision.".

* Replacing the text ", and that such a decision was initiated" with the
text ", that such a decision was initiated, and that that decision's
voting period was initiated".


[Per ais523's judgement in CFJ 4118. We don't need to state the
requirement to "publish[] a valid notice" twice for initiating Agoran
decisions, and we should always ratify that the voting period was
initiated anyway.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 9283
Title: Welcome Package Tweak
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Mischief
Co-authors: 


Amend rule 2499 (Welcome Packages) by replacing:

       * One stamp of eir own type.
       * 10 spendies, if e has not been granted any spendies since e last
         registered.

with:

       * 15 spendies, if e has not been granted any spendies since e last
         registered.

[A frequent pattern is: a new person joins, gets a welcome package, does
essentially nothing further, then is deregistered. This results in a
proliferation of stamp types. The revised package allows a new player
the ability to purchase multiple stamps of eir own type, if e wants to
and does so.

Also, the welcome package as it stands now grants even players with too
many stamps to use the normal rule 2659 mechanism (6 spendies for X
stamps) yet another stamp of eir type.]
