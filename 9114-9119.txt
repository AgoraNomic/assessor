ID: 9114
Title: Grind Stone
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: snail
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2645 (The Stones) by replacing

{
      - Anti-Equatorial Stone (monthly): When wielded, the mossiest
        non-immune stone is transferred to the wielder. If more than one
        such stone is tied for mossiest, a specified one is transferred.
        When this happens, the wielded stone's mossiness is incremented
        by 1.
}

with

{
      - Grind Stone (quarterly): When wielded, if this is the 5th time the
wielder has wielded the Grind Stone (not the recursion stone) since any
other player wielded it, e wins the game.
}

Title: A friendly game v2
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: snail
Co-authors: juan, Janet, ais523, Yachay Wayllukuq


Enact the following rule with title "Bang!" and the following text:

{
Bangs are a fungible asset.

Vitality is an untracked player Switch with possible values of
Invulnerable, Alive, Unalive, or Ghostly (default). A player with a
Vitality that is not Ghostly is called “corporeal”, else e is called
"ghostly".

To "incarnate" is to flip one's Vitality to Invulnerable. A ghostly player
CAN
incarnate by announcement, provided there are only Invulnerable or Ghostly
players.

Each corporeal player SHOULD list eir Vitality and Bang Balance in all eir
messages.

Any player CAN publish a report of all Bang Balances and Vitalities. Such a
report SHOULD be made and Ratified Without Objection as needed.

Each Alive player CAN eliminate another specified Alive player by paying a
fee of 1 bang. Eliminating a player makes em Unalive, and then grants em 1
bang.

Any Alive player CAN Stand Alone by announcement, if there are no other
players that are Alive, and no person has won the game by doing so in the
past 7 days. When a player Stands Alone, e wins the game. If a player won
the game in this manner 4 days ago, then the match is reset.

When the match is reset, each player is set to Ghostly, all bangs are
destroyed, and then each player gains 1 bang.

When 7 days have passed since the match is reset, all Invulnerable
players have eir Vitality set to Alive.

When 14 days have passed since a player was last eliminated, the match
resets, and then each player that was alive immediately before the match
reset gains 1 bang.
}

The match is hereby reset.

Title: Self-Elimination
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Mischief

[Perhaps someone will find an interesting reason to do this. This proposal
should work with either version of the game.]

Amend the rule titled "Bang!" by replacing every instance of "another
specified Alive player" with "a specified Alive player"

Amend the rule titled "Bang for your Buck" by replacing every instance of
"another specified Alive player" with "a specified Alive player"

ID: 9119
Title: Say It Once Mk II
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Mischief
Co-authors: 


[This proposal quotes text that explicitly includes both references, so
this should be safe against unintended conflicts with other changes.]

Amend rule 1950 (Decisions with Adoption Indices) by, in the text reading:

       Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
       decisions and proposals, secured at power 2.  For decisions, the
       possible values are "none" (default) or integral multiples of 0.1
       from 1.0 to 9.9. For proposals, the possible values are integral
       multiples of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9 (default 1.0).

       The adoption index of a referendum CANNOT be set or changed to
       "none" or to a value less than that of its associated proposal. If
       a referendum ever has an adoption index of "none" or an adoption
       index less than that of its associated proposal, it is immediately
       set to the adoption index of the associated proposal.

       Adoption index is secured with a Power Threshold of 2.

deleting the sentence "Adoption index is secured with a Power Threshold of
2."
