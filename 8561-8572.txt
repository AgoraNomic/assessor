//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8561
Title: Election Cycle
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: nix


Create a power=2 rule, "The Election Cycle", with the following text:

  A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by
  winning an election, and has not won an election for that office
  since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either
  vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.

  An office is term-limited if the most recent election for that
  office was resolved more than the length of that office's term
  prior. The term for the office of Prime Minister is 90 days. The
  term for all other elected offices is 180 days.

  A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office:

  a) with 2 support, if either the office is interim or term-
     limited, and provided that the initiator becomes a candidate
     in the same message.

  b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP (or, if the office is the
     ADoP, if e is the Assessor) and the office is interim, or if
     e is the holder of that office.

  Once per quarter, the ADoP CAN and SHALL publish a Notice of
  Election specifying between 2-4 term-limited offices (if there
  fewer than 2 term-limited offices, the ADoP MUST instead list
  all of them).  Such a notice initiates elections for the
  specified offices.  The ADoP SHOULD prioritize offices that
  have gone longest since their last elections.

  The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
  initiated if one is already in progress.


[Delete this section added to the previous rule - better gathers
election procedure rules in one place].

Amend Rule 1006 (Offices) by removing:
  A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by
  winning an election, and has not won an election for that office
  since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either
  vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.


[For the below rule, remove text placed in the new rule above,
and add the Assessor as the vote collector for ADoP elections].

Amend Rule 2154 (Election Procedure) to read in full:

  When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
  which lasts for 4 days. After an election is initiated and until
  nominations close, any player CAN become a candidate by
  announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e ceases to
  be a player during the election or if holding the office would
  make em Overpowered. During the nomination period, a candidate CAN
  cease to be a candidate by announcement if there is at least one
  other candidate.

  An election whose nomination period is complete is contested if it
  has two or more candidates, and uncontested otherwise. Nominations
  close at the end of the poll's voting period or when the election
  is ended, whichever comes first.

  After the nomination period ends, the ADoP (or, if the office is
  the ADoP, the Assessor) CAN and, in a timely fashion, SHALL:

  1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision to
     select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
     decision, the Vote Collector is the ADoP (or, if the office
     is the ADoP, the Assessor), the valid options are
     the candidates for that election (including those who become
     candidates after its initiation), and the voting method is
     instant runoff. When the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a
     player, wins the election. If the outcome is not a player, the
     election ends with no winner.

  2) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
     immediately.

  If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
  then any player CAN by announcement declare em the winner of the
  election, thereby causing em to win the election. If at any point
  an uncontested election has no candidates, then any player CAN
  declare the election ended with no winner by announcement.

  When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated
  office and the election ends.

Title: Sponsorship is not Co-authorship
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Aspen
Co-authors: 


[It's always felt weird to me that pending a proposal now
makes you a co-author. That's not what co-authorship
means, IMO. Also, it goes against my mental invariant
that proposals are immutable after creation.]

Amend rule 2622, "Pending Proposals", by deleting the text:

  If the player did not create the proposal and is not
  listed in the list of co-authors of the proposal,
  e is added to the list of co-authors.

[For context, here's the current text of the paragraph:

  Any player CAN pay 1 Pendant to flip the Pended switch of a
  specified proposal to True. If the player did not create the
  proposal and is not listed in the list of co-authors of the
  proposal, e is added to the list of co-authors. When e does so,
  the proposal becomes sponsored.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8565
Title: Popularity Contest
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Aspen
Co-authors: 


Enact a new power 1.0 Rule entitled "Popularity Contest",
with the following text:

  Immediately after the adoption of this rule, Aris wins the
  game. Then, for each person who voted unconditionally FOR the
  referendum on the proposal that enacted this rule, this
  rule causes that person to earn a Black Ribbon.

  Aris CAN cause this rule to make a specified player
  earn a Black Ribbon by announcement. Aris can
  cause this rule to award a specified player
  a specified patent title containing the
  string "Popular" by announcement.

  If it has been at least one month since this rule
  was adopted, any person CAN End the Contest
  by announcement, causing this rule to repeal itself.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Title: Anti-AI escalation
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: 


Amend rule 1950 by appending the following to the first paragraph: " If
a referendum has an adoption index less than the adoption index of its
associated proposal, the referendum's adoption index is immediately set
to that of the associated proposal".

[Prevents a potential 2->3 power escalation where a Power 2 dictatorship
can set the AI of the referendum on an AI 3 proposal to 1, then force it
through at AI 1.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8569
Title: Fixing Festivals
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: Aspen, Murphy


Amend Rule 2124 by replacing the following text:

{

  The entities eligible to support or object to an intent to perform
  an action are, by default, all players, subject to modification by
  the document authorizing the dependent action.

}

with the following text:

{

  A document that authorizes a dependent action, by default, implicitly
  asserts that all players are eligible to support or object to an intent
  to perform that action; if the document is a rule, conflicts about
  eligibility (including conflicts with such an implicit assertion) are
  resolved using the normal procedures.

}


Set the power of Rule 2480 (Festivals) to 3.1.

Set the power of Rule 2481 (Festival Restrictions) to 3.1.


Amend Rule 2481 (Festival Restrictions) by replacing "Non-Festive
players are never considered Supporters of a dependent action" with
"Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, non-Festive players are not
eligible to support a dependent action".


[Currently, eligibility to object/support to a dependent action is
defined wholly by the rule defining the action. This breaks the festival
rule that non-festive players are not considered supporters. This
proposal changes the definition of eligibility so that it uses the
normal precedence rules, then raises the power of Festivals so that it
applies to the highest-power dependent action (emergency regulation
changes).]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8570
Title: Emergency Regulation Clarification
Adoption index: 3.1
Author: Jason
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2614 by replacing "Award Patent Titles not mentioned in any
Rule and Badges" with "Award Patent Titles that are either Badges or are
not mentioned in any Rule".

[Just a minor wording tweak, this has always looked weird to me.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8571
Title: Gauntlet announcement patch
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2644 (The Gauntlet) to read, in whole:

{

  A player CAN, by announcement, Notice the Gauntlet, specifying a single
  player that owns 5 or more stones. When e does, the specified player
  Wields the Gauntlet.

  When a player Wields the Gauntlet, e wins the game, then all existing
  stones are transferred to Agora.

}

[This removes the possibility of accidentally causing someone to Wield
the Gauntlet by changing the "correct announcement" to a specific
action. For instance, I am concerned that a Stonemason's weekly report
might be considered such an announcement.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8572
Title: Thou shalt not disobey Trigon
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: Trigon


Amend Rule 2545 by appending the following to the paragraph beginning
"When the rules authorize": "Persons who voluntarily participate in an
auction (including the auctioneer) SHALL NOT violate requirements that
auction's method that are clearly intended to be punishable as rules
violations; doing so is the Class N Crime of Auction
Manipulation, where N is the class specified in the auction method (or 2
otherwise)."
