Amend Rule 1681 ("The Logical Rulesets") by deleting the text from "The
Readable Logical Ruleset (RLR)" (inclusive) to the end of the rule.

Repeal Rule 2693 ("The Simplifior").


[We have yet to see a report from this office and nobody has pointed
this out or expressed interest in deputising, suggesting that the report
is infeasible and/or not useful.]

report as appropriate), that includes all such information.

[The intent behind this proposal is to make it possible to
unambiguously identify whether an office has missed a report, by
requiring the report to be labelled as one, and thus makes it possible
to deputise based on a missed report.]

Title: Untracked hats
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2594 ("Hats") by replacing "Hats are a secured player switch"
with "Hats are a secured untracked player switch" and by replacing the
paragraph beginning "A player CAN change eir hat" with the following
paragraph:

{

A player CAN change eir hat to a valid value by public designation.

explicit "notification" to any person (in any event, it's unclear what
it means to "notify" oneself).]

Title: The Bounty Board
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: snail
Co-authors: 


Enact a new Rule with title "Bounties" and the following text:
{
Bounty Amount is an untracked player switch. Its possible values are all
integers from 0 to 10 inclusive, where 0 is the default.

Twice each month, each player CAN, by announcement, put a bounty on a
specified player. Doing so increases the specified player's Bounty Amount
by 1.

Immediately after an alive player is eliminated, the shooter gains a number
of spendies equal to the target's Bounty Amount, and then the target's
bounty amount is flipped to 0.

The shooter SHOULD publish the target's Bounty Amount at the time of the
elimination when e eliminates a target with a non-zero Bounty Amount.
}
