Title: Unbreaking Motions
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: snail
Co-authors: 4st


Change the power of Rule 2463 ("Motion of No Confidence") to 2.
[Offices are secured, so you can't actually remove the PM in this way
currently.]

Title: AI security revisited
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: ais523


Amend R1607 by replacing "A referendum is the Agoran decision to
determine whether to adopt a proposal." with "A referendum is the Agoran
decision to determine whether to adopt a proposal (its associated
proposal)."

[Define this undefined term.]


Amend Rule 1950 by, as a single amendment:

{

Deleting "If a referendum has an adoption index less than the adoption
index of its associated proposal, the referendum's adoption index is
immediately set to that of the associated proposal".

Then, inserting the following paragraph after the first paragraph:

{

The adoption index of a referendum CANNOT be set or changed to "none" or
to a value less than that of its associated proposal. If a referendum
ever has an adoption index of "none" or an adoption index less than that
of its associated proposal, it is immediately set to the adoption index
of the associated proposal.

}

}

[Prevent a low-powered rule from attempting to continuously set the
value of an AI, causing it to perhaps become indeterminate.]

Amend Rule 2642 (Gathering Stones) by replacing this text:

       with the highest Modified Rockiness that reached for a stone in
       the previous week is transferred to em. In a tie, the stone
       specified by the tied player who reached first is transferred to
       em. When a player receives a stone in this way, eir Base Rockiness
       is set to 0.

with this text:

       At the beginning of each week, each stone owned by Agora is
       transferred to the player (if any) with the highest Modified
       Rockiness that reached for that stone in the previous week,
       with ties broken in favor of the tied player who reached for
       that stone first. When a player receives a stone in this way,
