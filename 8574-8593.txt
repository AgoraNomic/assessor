//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8574
Title: mending the quill
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Trigon
Co-authors: Janet, Aspen


[ Comment: It is not unusual for the final draft of a proposal to be
   submitted by someone other than the person who did most of the
   drafting for that proposal. These proposals have, in several
   instances, made it to the finals. Notably, during the Silver Quill
   2020 discussions, an honorable mention was given to Interesting
   Chambers, which I wrote and did revisions on but never wrote the final
   version of. This kind of stuff has happened before. It isn't too
   worrying, but it would be nice to not have to work around it. Plus,
   proposals are cheap. ]

Amend Rule 2582 by replacing:

  - Silver Quill, awardable by the Promotor to the author of a
    proposal of outstanding merit and influence on the game
    (additional information: ID Number of the proposal).

with:

  - Silver Quill, awardable by the Promotor to the author of a
    proposal of outstanding merit and influence on the game, or to
    a coauthor, although e SHOULD only do so if it is generally
    agreed that that coauthor contributed more to that proposal
    than the person who submitted it (additional information: ID
    Number of the proposal).

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8575
Title: Stone Win Delay v2
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Gaelan


Amend Rule 2644 to read, in whole:

{

  A player CAN, by announcement, Notice the Gauntlet, specifying a single
  player that owns 5 or more stones, provided that no person has done so
  in the past 30 days.

  When the Gauntlet is Noticed, the specified player wins the game. If the
  Gauntlet was Noticed 4 days ago, then all existing stones are
  transferred to Agora.

}


[Adds a delay to stone wins to bring it inline with VP wins. Also adds a
prevention for rapid-fire stone wins. This doesn't allow the bearer of
many stones to prevent the win, in order to maintain a balance of stone
power.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8576
Title: "By announcement" loosening
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Aspen, Murphy


Amend Rule 478 by replacing the following:

{

  Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
  announcement", that person performs that action by unambiguously and
  clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs it.

}

with the following:

{

  Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
  announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single public
  message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to perform that
  action by sending that message, doing both clearly and unambiguously.

}


[This unambiguously makes "CFJ: X" and "Proposal: X" work, even though
neither explicitly says they are performing an action, since they both
clearly and unambiguously set forth intent to perform the associated
action. The "by sending that message" part was suggested by Aris, and
prevents "I want to CFJ X at some point" from accidentally taking an
action, even though it arguably sets forth intent to initiate a CFJ.
This also brings the standard for "by announcement" in line with
initiating a decision and casting a ballot, which both require a notice
that "sets forth intent".]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8578
Title: Auction limitation
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Trigon


Amend Rule 2545 by appending the following to the paragraph beginning
"The rule that authorizes":

{

  The rule that authorizes the auction further authorizes the transfer or
  destruction of currency from persons who have bid voluntarily, as
  specified by the chosen auction method. The authorization to conduct the
  auction does not provide any further authorization than that explicitly
  described in this rule.

}

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8579
Title: AI voting method clarification v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Trigon


If Rule 1950 contains the text 'For any Agoran decision with an adoption
index', amend Rule 1950 by replacing the text 'For any Agoran decision
with an adoption index' with 'For any Agoran decision with a non-"none"
adoption index'.

[Legislates the decision in CFJ 3746. All Agoran decisions possess an
adoption index switch, but some of them have the value "none". Now with
less ambiguous quotation marks!]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8580
Title: Strength Buying Separation v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: ais523, Trigon


Amend Rule 2422 by deleting the following text:

{

  A player CAN Buy Strength by paying a fee of 1 Extra Vote. A player's
  Voting Strength on an ordinary referendum is 1 greater for every time e
  Bought Strength during that decision's voting period.

}


Enact a new Rule entitled "Buying Strength" with power 2 and text as
follows:

{

  A player CAN Buy Strength by paying a fee of 1 Extra Vote. A player's
  Voting Strength on referendum on an ordinary proposal is 1 greater for
  every time e Bought Strength during that decision's voting period.

}


[Fixes the ambiguity that ais523 pointed out, and also removes the usage
of the undefined term "ordinary referendum", replacing it with the
well-defined but clunky "referendum on an ordinary proposal".]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8581
Title: Grants on Resets
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Aspen
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2621, "VP Wins", by replacing:

  When a player takes over the economy, e wins the game. If a player
  Took Over the Economy 4 days ago, all Cards and all Products are
  destroyed, then each active player is granted 1 card of each type.

with:

  When a player takes over the economy, e wins the game. Four days
  later, all Cards and all Products are destroyed. Then, each
  active player gains 1 card of each type and eir grant (if any).

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8582
Title: The Artistry Lies in the Art
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Aspen
Co-authors: 


[I used "Artistry" rather than "Art" to distinguish it from references
to the liberal arts. Later, I realized that those references use
"Arts" as in "Bachelor of Arts". So we're fine to just use Art here.]

Amend Rule 1367, "Degrees", by replacing each instance of "Artistry"
with "Art".

Change each instance of the patent title "Associate of Nomic
Artistry" to "Associate of Nomic Arts".

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8583
Title: Clarify switches
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2162 (Switches) section 2 by replacing "if no default is
specified" with "if no default is otherwise specified".

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8585
Title: Clarify variable voting period
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 107 (Initiating Agoran Decisions) by replacing this text:

  The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
  for the decision. The voting period lasts for 7 days. The minimum
  voting period for a decision with at least two options is five
  days. The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to
  a duration longer than fourteen days. Changing the length of a
  decision's voting period is secured at power 2.

with this text:

  The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
  for the decision. The default length of the voting period is 7
  days. Changing the length of a decision's voting period is secured
  at power 2, and it CANNOT be set or changed to more than 14 days,
  or less than 5 days for a decision with at least two options.

Title: Secret proposal B
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: ATMunn
Co-authors: 


If ATMunn has published a document entitled "Secret document B" with the
SHA-256 hash of
bf9e005c5f78e9dda0b3ffe7bef9d78b58a11fe7f3452b8cffc02de1a78b0b20 before
the enactment of this proposal, then the effects described in that
document take place.
