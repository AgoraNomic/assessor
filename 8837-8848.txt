The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8840
Title: Cleanliness security
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2221 by appending the following paragraph:

{

Cleaning rules is secured. Refiling rules is secured.

}


[This is maybe arguably not necessary based on the exact wording of
R2221, but better safe than sorry.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8842
Title: Losing Focus
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Pilgore
Co-authors: nix, Jason, Madrid


Repeal R2638 (Player Focuses)
Repeal R2605 (Ministries)

Amend R2645 (The Stones) to delete the bullet point which reads:
  Concentration Stone (monthly, 60%): A specified player (defaulting to the
  wielder if not specified) gains the Grant associated with eir Focus.
and replace it with:
  Jockey Stone (monthly, 60%): A specified Running horse's Race Position is
  increased by 1.

If at the time this proposal is adopted the Concentration Stone is owned
by a player, that player becomes the owner of the Jockey Stone. Otherwise,
Agora becomes the owner of the Jockey Stone.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8843
Title: Time B Safe
Adoption index: 4.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: Jason, Murphy


Amend Rule 1698 (Agora Is A Nomic) by replacing:
      adopted within a four-week period.
with:
      adopted within a real-world (UTC) four-week period.

[
In discord, a Power-5 Rule was suggested: "Rules to the contrary
notwithstanding, this rule CANNOT be changed in January or February of
2023".

Up until the time a proposal to change this rule could take effect before
January 2023, Agora would not be ossified. But then you cross a time
boundary and Agora would become ossified. One *possible* interpretation of

>      If any other single change or inseparable group of changes to the
>      gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
>      Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
>      to the contrary notwithstanding.

is that the "cancelled change" would be time passing!  With the conclusion
that time had (as a legal fiction) stopped, with no way of getting it
started again. So this proposal puts an extra protection on time by making
it clear that only "real world" time is relevant. The title a reference B
nomic, an established nomic some years back that was killed when they
accidentally stopped time or at least couldn't get it started again.
