[ Comment: It is not unusual for the final draft of a proposal to be
   submitted by someone other than the person who did most of the
   drafting for that proposal. These proposals have, in several
   instances, made it to the finals. Notably, during the Silver Quill
   2020 discussions, an honorable mention was given to Interesting
   Chambers, which I wrote and did revisions on but never wrote the final
   version of. This kind of stuff has happened before. It isn't too
   worrying, but it would be nice to not have to work around it. Plus,

Amend Rule 1030 (Precedence between Rules) to read:

   - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
     itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule), and
     such provisions would resolve the conflict without
     contradictions, then they shall be used to do so.

   - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
     the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
     Power.

   - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
     precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
     determining precedence relations, then the determinations of the
     precedence-determining Rule shall be used to do so.

   - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
     itself that it takes precedence over another Rule (or type of
     Rule), and such provisions would resolve the conflict without
     contradictions, then they shall be used to do so.

   - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
     with the lowest ID number takes precedence.

   - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.

   Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence or
   deference (e.g. over or to "all rules" of a certain class) shall
   be, prima facie, considered to be limited claims of precedence or
   deference that are applicable only when such claims are evaluated
   as described within the above sequence.

   No change to the ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
   directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of determining
   precedence. This applies to changes by the enactment or amendment
   of a Rule, or of any other form. This Rule takes precedence over

Amend Rule 2154 (Election Procedure) to read:

  A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office:

  a) with 2 support, if either the office is interim or the most
    recent election for that office was resolved more than 90 days
    prior, and provided that the initiator becomes a candidate in
    the same message.

  b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP and if the office is interim,
    or if e is the holder of that office.

  The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
  initiated if one is already in progress.

  When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
  which lasts for 4 days. During the nomination period, any player
  CAN become a candidate by announcement, and any candidate CAN
  cease to be a candidate by announcement if there is at least one
  other candidate.

  After the nomination period, any player CAN still become a
  candidate by announcement until the end of the election or the
  end of the voting period, whichever comes first.

  A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e ceases to be a player
  during the election, or if holding the office would make em
  Overpowered.

  An election whose nomination period is complete is contested if it
  has two or more candidates, and uncontested otherwise.

  If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
  then any player CAN by announcement declare em the winner of the
  election, thereby causing em to win the election. If at any point
  an uncontested election has no candidates, then any player CAN
  declare the election ended with no winner by announcement.

  After the nomination period ends, the ADoP CAN and, in a timely
  fashion, SHALL:

  1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision to
    select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
    decision, the Vote Collector is the ADoP, the valid options are
    the candidates for that election (including those who become
    candidates after its initiation), and the voting method is
    instant runoff. When the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a
    player, wins the election. If the outcome is not a player, the
    election ends with no winner.

  2) If the election is uncontested, end the election as described
    above.

  When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated
  office and the election ends.

[Allowing players to become candidates after the "nomination period" is
  confusing; it's more like a "nomination-only period". This would at
  least separate becoming / ceasing to be a candidate into "during the
  nominating period", then "after the nominating period", then "also any
