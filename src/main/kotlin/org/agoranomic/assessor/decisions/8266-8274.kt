[Create a mechanism for a public message to be defined as self-ratifying a
statement that's not in the message.

Currently, Rule 2034 does this in a strange implicit way, by saying that the
message "constitutes self-ratifying claims that" such-and-such.  I'd call it
dubious, but according to CFJ 3618 as recorded in a FLR annotation (I can't
find the original judgement), it does work, even if the message in question
*explicitly disclaims* the such-and-such.  Still, it's better to organize
things in a way that avoids counterfactual assumptions.

Convert two rules to use the new mechanism: Rule 2034, and Rule 107, which
previously vaguely mentioned an error being "correctly identified within one
week".  The new wording also requires clarity, as I also proposed separately
(if both proposal pass, this overwrites the wording from the other).]
