Enact a new power 3.1 Rule, entitled "Timelines", with the following text:

  A timeline is a temporal sequence of events and states.

  The Objective Timeline is the timeline of matters as they actually happened.
  On the Objective Timeline, the consequences of an event are determined
  based on the conditions actually in effect, under Agoran law, when that event
  occurred. The Objective Timeline is not part of the gamestate; instead, it
  is the recording of events on reality itself, and changing it retroactively
  without actual time travel is thus IMPOSSIBLE, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding.

  The Standard Timeline is the timeline used for the purposes of ordinary
  gameplay. By default, the Standard Timeline is defined by events and their
  consequences in the same way that the Objective Timeline is. However,
  the Standard Timeline is part of the gamestate. Accordingly, it can be
  modified retroactively; such retroactive modifications are secured
  at power 3.

  Attempted retroactive changes are to be interpreted as attempts to change the
  Standard Timeline. All changes are to be interpreted as prospective unless
  they are explicitly retroactive.

  By default, any entity with a power less than the power of this rule that
  refers to the past, present, or future is to be interpreted as referring to
  the Standard Timeline; however, entities may explicitly reference
  different timelines.

are also honorable reasons to self-recuse (e.g. self-interest in the
case).  Changed this to the idea of "if you're recused in any way after
being assigned 4+ days, let us know why, before getting another case",

figure out if the recused are still interested in judging.

Amend Rule 1728 to read, in whole:

  The following methods of taking actions are known as "dependent
  actions":

  1. without N objections, where N is a positive integer no greater
  than 8 ("without objection" is shorthand for this method with N = 1);

  2. with N support, where N is a positive integer ("with support" is
  shorthand for this method with N = 1);

  3. with N Agoran consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1 with
  a minimum of 1 ("With Agoran consent" is shorthand for this method
  with N = 1);

  4. with notice; or

  5. with T notice, where T is a time period.

  N is 1 unless otherwise specified.


Amend Rule 2595 as follows:

  In the first sub-bullet under item 2 of the only list, replace the
  text "with T Notice" with the text "with T notice".

  In the second sub-bullet under item 2 of the only list, replace the
  text "Without N Objections, With N Support, or With N Agoran
  Consent" with the text "without N objections, with N support, or

  1. The action is to be performed Without N objections, and there are
  at least N Objectors to that intent.

  2. The action is to be performed With N support, and there are fewer
