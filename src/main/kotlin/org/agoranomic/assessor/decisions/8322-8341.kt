[Comments:

Are we just going to let a steady stream of sufficiently dedicated
players claim their standard victories? I say we raise the bar a
little.

There's been some talk of a larger re-working of the economy. In the
meantime, this proposal calls for players to vote on a new number to
replace the 1,000 coin victory fee. The median vote wins, favouring the
higher vote if there are two middle votes.

]

For the purpose of this proposal:

* An Inflation Ballot is a body of text published during the voting
  period of this proposal that clearly, directly and without
  obfuscation specifies a single non-negative integer and that it is an
  Inflation Ballot.

* Each player's Inflation Vote is the integer specified in the last
  Inflation Ballot they published, or "none" if they never published
  one.

* P is the number of players with Inflation Votes other than "none".

* Median is the (unique) integer such that that at least P/2 Inflation
  Votes are integers greater than or equal to Median, and at least
  (P/2+0.5) Inflation votes are integers less than or equal to Median.

Amend Rule 2483 (Economics) by replacing "1,000" with Median, written
in decimal with commas separating groups of three digits, as in
"12,345,678"."""
