  values are lists of ministries, defaulting to the empty list. The
  ADoP CAN flip an office's interest without objection.

  voting strength is increased by 2 on proposals whose chamber is
  set to that ministry.


Enact a new Rule of Power 2.0, entitled "Proposal Classes", with the
following text:

  Proposals created since the enactment of this rule have an
  untracked Class switch with possible values ordinary (the default)
  and democratic.

  When a proposal with an adoption index greater than 2.0 is
  created, its class becomes democratic.

  Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip an ordinary proposal's
  class to democratic, provided that it is in the Proposal Pool or
  that there is an Agoran decision on its adoption whose voting
  period has not yet ended.


Enact a new Rule of Power 2.0, entitled "Proposal Chambers", with the
following text:

  Chamber is an untracked ordinary proposal switch whose possible
  values include unset (the default) and each of the ministries of
  Agora.

  A proposal's chamber SHOULD only be decided by which ministry's
  goals it effects to the greatest degree.

  Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip the chamber of an
  ordinary proposal to any ministry, provided that it is in the

  is known as a contract. A contract may be modified, including
  by changing the set of parties, with the consent of all

  parties to it falls below one. It is IMPOSSIBLE for a person to

  Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in

  provisions or parties of a contract to become publicly unavailable is canceled

  available are known as its body; the remainder of the provisions are known

  explicitly and unambiguously permitted by the contract's body:

  * Act on behalf of another party to the contract.

  * By announcement, revoke destructible assets from the contract.

  * By announcement, transfer liquid assets from the contract to a specified

  2. every contract, with its title, full provisions, and parties.

  If the Notary is required to report a title, but none has been otherwise
  publicly provided, e CAN select one.

  The transitional period lasts for at least 90 days after this rule comes
  into force; thereafter, any player CAN end it by announcement.
  A pledge or contract is invisible if it was created before this rule came
  into force, and has not been publicly posted since this rule came into force;
  for a contract, this publication must include its full provisions and list of
  parties, along with a certification or adequate proof of their accuracy and
  completeness. During the transitional period, the Notary NEED NOT report
  any invisible contract or pledge. When the transitional period is ended,
  each invisible contract or pledge ceases to exist in the order they were
  created, and then this rule amends itself by deleting this paragraph.

Make Gaelan the Notary."""
