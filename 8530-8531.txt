ID: 8530
Title: No Honour
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: nix
Co-authors: Jason


Repeal R2510, "Such is Karma".

[Karma gets rare, sporadic usage and I'd prefer not to maintain it if
it's not going to be used. I'm also open to supporting efforts to revive
it, but I don't have the time/interest to write such proposals myself
right now.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8531
Title: Patent Title Restoration v2
Adoption index: 1.5
Author: Jason
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 649 by replacing "A Patent Title is a legal title given to a
person in recognition of the person's distinction" with "A Patent Title
is a legal title held by an entity in recognition of eir distinction".

[The current version could plausibly be read to strip patent titles when
an entity ceases to be a person. This makes it so that patent titles can
be held by all entities, but can only be awarded to persons. The
requirement on personhood/citizenship is explicit for most awarding
methods (including the Herald's general method), while the other methods
require 2 Agoran consent, which should be enough to prevent them going
to non-persons if we don't want them to as a group. There's not really
an easy place to put an explicit restriction, because some of the 2
Agoran consent methods are at Power 3, while the patent titles rule is
at Power 1.5.]

Award all Patent Titles to eir former holders that were lost solely due
to the entity not being a person (under any current or former definition
of "person"), other than Hero of Agora Nomic or Grand Hero of Agora Nomic.

[Don't try to award HAN/GHAN because it seems unlikely they were ever
stripped and because this proposal doesn't have high enough AI to do so.]
