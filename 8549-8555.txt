//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8549
Title: You Can Only Stack Turtles So High
Adoption index: 2.2
Author: Aspen
Co-authors: Gaelan, G.


[This fixes G.'s scam, which would otherwise allow indeterminacy to be
created through infinite promise loops.]

Amend Rule 2618, "Promises", by inserting, after the text:

  A promise's bearer CAN, by announcement, cash the promise,
  provided that any conditions for cashing it specified by its text
  are unambiguously met. By doing so, e acts on the creator of the
  promise's behalf, causing the creator to act as if e published the
  promise's text, and destroys the promise.

the text:

  However, to limit recursion, no promise can be cashed during the execution
  of another promise unless it existed before the execution of that promise
  began.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8553
Title: Slightly less apathetic
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2465, "Victory by Apathy", by replacing the final "."
character with the following: ", except for those who have won the game
through this Rule in the past 14 days."

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8554
Title: I Want My Promise Back!
Adoption index: 2.2
Author: Aspen
Co-authors: nix


[This is intended to remove the need to put in a special provision
to a promise allow the creator to destroy a promise in the possession of
the Library. Since that's usually what's wanted, this makes it the
default behavior, while still allowing the creator to override it.]

Amend Rule 2618, "Promises", by inserting, after the text:

  The Library is an entity and CAN own promises. Any player CAN take
  a specified promise from the Library by announcement, provided e
  cashes the promise in the same message.

the text:

  The creator of a promise CAN take or revoke it from the Library by
  announcement, unless the promise's text unambiguously designates
  it as irrevocable.
