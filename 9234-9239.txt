Title: Prix Fixe
Adoption index: 1
Author: Mischief

[The variable cost nature of this fee means that from time to time, one
failed purchase causes subsequent purchases to fail. To simplify things,
this switches it to a flat fee since a player's Spendie holdings already
limit how many times e can do this. It is calibrated so that the three
purchases per month afforded by 20 Spendies have the same cost as today.]
Amend rule 2659 (Stamps) by replacing:

       Any player CAN pay a fee of 5 + (X) Spendies to transfer a
       specified stamp from the L&FD to emself. X is equal to the number
       of times e has already done so in the current month.

with:

       Any player CAN pay a fee of 6 Spendies to transfer a specified
       stamp from the L&FD to emself.

Amend Rule 2438 (Ribbons) by replacing this text:      Gray (A): Once

       specified player to earn a Gray Ribbon. E is ENCOURAGED to do so
       before publishing eir monthly report.

["In the same message" doesn't play well with my recordkeeping software,
  and I don't think anyone has mentioned this clause any time recently.]
