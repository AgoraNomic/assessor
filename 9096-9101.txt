The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 9097
Title: Festival strength restrictions
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2481 ("Festival Restrictions") by replacing "Each Festive
player has the maximum possible voting strength. All other players have
the minimum possible voting strength." with "Each Festive player has the
maximum possible voting strength. Each person who is not a Festive
player has the minimum possible voting strength. Rules to the contrary
notwithstanding, no modifications to voting strength (other than
defining the maximum and minimum) are applied by any other Rule.".

[Clarify that setting strength to the maximum/minimum cannot then be
altered with Blots or bonuses, since it's currently unclear whether the
method of calculation in R2422 applies. Additionally, don't allow
non-Festive players to escape the penalty by deregistering.]

ID: 9098
Title: Welcome Spendies

Author: snail
