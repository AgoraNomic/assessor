Amend R2557, "Sentencing Guidelines" by replacing:

    When the rules authorize an investigator to issue a Warning for a
    violation, e CAN do so by announcement if the violation is described
    by the rules as a "Class N Crime" where N is 0 or an expression that
    evaluates to 0.

with:

    When the rules authorize an investigator to issue a Warning for a

    * the violation is a crime of class 1 and e has not done so for the

Amend R2143, "Official Reports and Duties" by replacing:

    Failure of a person to perform any duty required of em within the

with:

    Failure of a person to perform any weekly duty required of em within
    the allotted time is the Class 1+N Crime of Weekly Tardiness, where
    N is the number of times e has previously committed the crime in the
    last month.

    Failure of a person to perform any monthly duty required of em
    within the allotted time is the Class 3 Crime of Monthly Tardiness.

Amend R2138 "The Associate Director of Personnel" by appending:

      4. For filled offices with a weekly report, the number of weeks in
         scope, and the number and percent of those weeks during which

{

While an auction is ongoing, if the rules provide for that class of

auction that CANNOT be conducted and COULD NOT have been conducted in
the previous week immediately terminates with no winner.

}
