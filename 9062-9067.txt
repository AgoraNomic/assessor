The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 9062
Title: Insurance Policy
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: kiako
Co-authors: ais523


Amend Rule 2640 ("Stones") by removing "active" from the following:

   Ownership of stones is entirely restricted to Agora and active players.

Then, amend Rule 2642 ("Gathering Stones") by replacing "an active player"
with "a player" in the following:

   Base Rockiness is an active player switch,

and by replacing "each player" with "each active player" in the following:

   Once a week each player CAN "reach" for a specified stone owned by Agora
by announcement.

[ Comment: ais523 raised the interesting point in the Discord/IRC that
"inactive" used to be an option when a player would be away for a while,
but now spells an economic death sentence, which this aims to alleviate. ]
