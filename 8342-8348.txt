The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8345
Title: Self-punishment
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2555 (Blots) by inserting the following paragraph after the
paragraph beginning "Levying fines and destroying blots":

  A person CAN, by announcement, create a specified number of blots in
  eir possession.

Amend Rule 2535 (Zombies) by inserting the following list item before
the item that says "deregister.":

  - create blots;

[This is intended to allow contracts to provide enforcement mechanisms
other than R1742's general "SHALL act in accordance with that contract".
For example, a contract could grant an Enforcer the ability to act on
behalf of other parties to create blots in the possession of the other
party. This could also, potentially, reduce work on the Referee.

The zombie provision is intended to prevent zombie owners from screwing
over their zombies.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8346
Title: De-secure Black Ribbons v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: ais523


Amend Rule 2438 (Ribbons) by replacing the text "This rule does not
specify any methods of obtaining Black Ribbons." with the text "An
Instrument CAN, as part of its effect, cause a person to earn a Black
Ribbon. When this occurs, this Rule awards that person a Black Ribbon.".

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8347
Title: R2141 power increase v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Set Rule 2141's power to 3.1

[Rationale: Rule 2141 (Role and Attributes of Rules) defines
(unsurprisingly) what rules are and what they can do. This is
sufficiently important that it should take precedence over other power-3
rules. This doesn't protect it from power-3 instruments (since nothing
can), but it does help it from accidentally losing a precedence battle,
especially with its relatively high ID number.]
