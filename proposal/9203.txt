Amend Rule 991 ("Calls for Judgement") by appending the following to the
first paragraph: "A case so initiated is an inquiry case."

["inquiry case" is a historical term used for a CFJ on the truth of a
statement. It has a few remaining uses in the rules. Defining it here
removes any ambiguity and helps answer a question that has been asked
multiple times by newer players. This is careful to not redefine "CFJ"
itself, which might affect past CFJs.]
