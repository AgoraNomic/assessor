Amend Rule 2588 (Sectors) to read:

  Sectors are entities. Each Sector has an ID number, which is an
  ordered list of three coordinates, each of which is one of
  (-1, 0, +1). There is one Sector for each such list. These ID
  numbers are ordered by their first coordinate, with ties broken
  by the second, then the third.

  If no Spaceship is in a particular Sector, then that Sector is
  "empty"; otherwise it is "occupied".

  Two Sectors are "adjacent" if one of their coordinates differ by
  exactly 1 and their others are the same.

Repeal Rule 2589 (Galaxy Maintenance).

Move spaceships to Sectors as follows, based on their owners:

(-1, -1, -1) omd
(-1, -1,  0) Aris
(-1, -1, +1) Gaelan
(-1,  0, -1) G.
