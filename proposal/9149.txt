Amend Rule 2696 ("Bang Actions") by replacing:
{
if the shooter is alive and has two bangs
}
with
{
if the shooter is alive and has at least two bangs
}

[it's not really exploitable, but rather just annoying: having your reveal
fail bc you had more than 2 bangs for any reason, since you can simply
transfer bangs away from you freely.]
