Amend Rule 2480 ("Festivals") by replacing the final paragraph with the
following paragraph:

{

A player who would be Festive if Agora's Festivity were N CAN flip it to
N (where N is an integer greater than Agora's Festivity) with 4 support
from other players who would be Festive if Agora's Festivity were N,
unless Agora's Festivity has had a value greater than or equal to N in
the past 21 days.

}

and by appending the following sentence to the first paragraph:

{

A Festival is ongoing whenever Agora's Festivity is non-zero.

}

and by replacing each instance of "nonzero" with "non-zero".

[Removes the definition of the action of Starting a Festival, which was
mildly redundant and, more importantly, did not have its POSSIBILITY
secured. Cleans up some other language to be more precise.]


Amend Rule 2481 ("Festival Restrictions") by replacing each instance of
"nonzero" with "non-zero".

[While we're here, normalize this language.]
