Amend rule 2675 ("Dream of Wandering") by adding
this paragraph to the beginning of the rule:
"Whenever this rule mentions a player or active player,
it can also mean a horse. Players may take actions on behalf of
horses e owns. Any effects that can only happen to players
instead happen to the horse's owner, such as transfer of assets,
increases in voting power, and the like."
