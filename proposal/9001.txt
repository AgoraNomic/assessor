[A separate rule for more powerful abilities, so changing the lower power
ones will be easier.]

Enact a new rule titled "Tier 2 Bright Abilities" at power 2, with the
following
text:

{
A player CAN, by paying a fee of 1 bright, increase the Adoption Index of a
specified Agoran Decision by 1.

A player CAN, by paying a fee of 2 brights, shine strongly. A player's
voting strength on a referendum on an ordinary proposal is increased by 3
if e shined strongly during the referendum's voting period.

A player CAN, by paying a fee of 2 brights, expunge up to 3 blots from a
specified player.

A player CAN, by paying a fee of 3 brights, wield a specified stone, rules
to the contrary notwithstanding.

A player CAN, by paying a fee of 20 brights, Outshine the Sun. The voting
strength of a player on ordinary referenda is increased by 1 if e has ever
Outshined the Sun. This bonus SHOULD be compensated if repealed.
