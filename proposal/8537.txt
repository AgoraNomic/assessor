[The only functionality change is to add a method for giving
people blots for a fee.  The rule has a typo, and needs a logical
rearrangement, so putting in the whole text.]

Amend Rule 2555 (Blots) to read in full.

  Blots are an indestructible fixed currency with ownership
  restricted to persons. A person with 1 or more blots is Impure, a
  person with 0 blots is Pure. An impure unregistered person is a
  Fugitive. The Referee is an office, and the recordkeepor for
  blots.

  To levy a fine of N on a person, where N is a positive integer or
  zero, is to grant em N blots. To expunge a blot is to destroy it.
  Levying fines and destroying blots are each secured with a Power
  Threshold of 1.7.

  A person CAN, by announcement, create a specified number of blots
  in eir possession.

  Any player CAN expunge a blot from a specified person (or emself
  if no one is specified) by paying a fee of one Blot-B-Gone.

  Any player CAN levy a fine of one blot on a specified person by
  paying a fee of two Blot-B-Gones, provided the specified person
  has not already gained two blots or more in the current week.

  At the beginning of each quarter, half (rounded down) of each
  fugitive's blots are destroyed.


Repeal Rule 2479 (Official Injustice).
