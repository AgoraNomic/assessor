[For a while I was both Herald and Registrar, so I kept track of
birthdays in the same documents that I kept track of active players.
Since Registrar was taken over by someone else, I've clearly been much
worse at tracking them. It makes more sense to put this with the office
that already tracks earliest registration dates (which are the
definition of birthdays).

Amend R2585 by replacing:

      In a timely manner after the start of a player's Agoran Birthday,
      the Herald SHALL announce it.

with:

      In a timely manner after the start of a player's Agoran Birthday,
      the Registrar SHALL announce it.
