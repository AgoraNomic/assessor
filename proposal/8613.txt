Title: The Name of the Win Cards v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: Trigon


In ascending numerical order, amend each enacted rule by
case-insensitively replacing, as a single amendment per Rule:

* "Victory Card" with "Win Card"

* "Victory Point" with "Winsome"

* "Extra Vote" with "Votive"


Win Card balances are hereby set to what Victory Card balances were at
the time immediately before this proposal began taking effect.

Winsome balances are hereby set to what Victory Point balances were at
the time immediately before this proposal began taking effect.

Votive balances are hereby set to what Extra Vote balances were at the
time immediately before this proposal began taking effect.

[This introduces more whimsy into the asset names and means that Voting
Card and Victory Card are no longer both VCs.]
