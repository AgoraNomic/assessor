Title: old judgements are good judgements
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: Jason, Publius Scribonius Scholasticus


Amend Rule 991 (Calls for Judgement) by replacing:
  At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
  assigned exactly one judgement.
with:
  At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
  assigned exactly one judgement that was validly assigned.

[Jason pointed out a while ago, that you could argue that when a judgement
option ceased to be defined (like UNDETERMINED has), it ceased to be a
judgement, so the case reverted to open.  Not sure if that's true, but
this makes sure the "validity when assigned" is what matters].
