# Convergence of P8868

If Rule 2642 is not titled "Gathering Stones", retitle to "Gathering
Stones".

If Rule 2642 does not have the following text, amend it to read, in
whole:
{
  A player who has not possessed a stone in the last 30 days CAN, by
  announcement, transfer the mossiest stone (if there is a tie, then
  a specified stone tied for mossiest) Agora owns to emself. E
  SHOULD specify the stone when doing so.
}

# Remove the concept of "scroll"s as a document, which may or may
# not work, and replace it with more wishy-washy "description of
# properties", which includes continuous effects like voting
# strength.
#
# Also, secure wielding.

Amend Rule 2640 by replacing the text "A scroll, which is a document
specifying the effects of the stone" with the text "A description of
the stone's properties".

Amend Rule 2641 by replacing the final paragraph with the following
paragraphs:
{
  When a stone is wielded, the Rule defining that stone applies any
  effects that it defines as occurring when the stone is wielded.

  The wielding of stones is secured.
}

Amend Rule 2645 ("The Stones") to read, in whole:
{
  The following stones are defined, one per paragraph, with the
  following format: Stone Name (Frequency, Smoothness): Description.

  - Power Stone (weekly, 2): When this stone is wielded, a specified
    player (defaulting to the wielder if not specified) is Power
    Stoned; Power Stoning is secured. A player's voting strength on
    a referendum on an ordinary proposal is increased by 3 for each
    time that e was Power Stoned during the referendum's voting
    period.

  - Soul Stone (weekly, 3): When wielded, the Soul Stone is
    transferred to the owner of a different specified non-immune
    stone, then that stone is transferred to the wielder.

  - Sabotage Stone (weekly, 4): When wielded, the adoption index of
    a specified AI-majority Agoran decision is increased by 1.

  - Jockey Stone (monthly, 3): When wielded, a specified Running
    horse's Race Position is increased by 1.

  - Protection Stone (monthly, 4): When wielded, a specified stone
    is granted immunity.

  - Recursion Stone (Monthly, 4): The Recursion Stone can be wielded
    once per month as if it had the power of any other stone of your
    choice.

  - Hot Potato Stone (Weekly, 5):  When this stone is wielded, the
    wielder specifies an eligible player and gains 8 points. The
    stone is transferred to the eligible player. An eligible player
    is one who has not owned this stone since the last time Agora
    owned it. If this  stone is not owned by Agora, it cannot
    otherwise be transferred, other rules notwithstanding. This
    stone is immune if 3 or more players have wielded it since the
    most recent collection notice.

  - Blank Stone (Monthly, 0): This stone has no effect.

  - Mason's Stone (None, 0): If the Mason's Stone is owned by the
    Stonemason, its Mossiness is continuously set to 0. If the
    Mason's Stone is owned by Agora, it is transferred to the
    Stonemason.

  - Anti-Equatorial Stone (Monthly, 5): When wielded, the mossiest
    stone is transferred to the wielder. When this happens, the
    Anti-Equatorial Stone's mossiness is incremented by 1.

  - Score Stone (Weekly, 3): When wielded, a specified player's
    (defaulting to the wielder if not specified) Score is increased
    by 3.
