Amend rule 2438 (Ribbons) by, after the paragraph reading:

       To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to flip that person's
       <that type> Ribbon Ownership to True. A person "owns a <Ribbon
       type>" if eir <that type> Ribbon Ownership is True.

adding a paragraph reading:

       A person CAN flip eir <Ribbon type> Ribbon Ownership to False by
       announcement.

[The 7-day timeout on ribbons means the person forfeits the current
opportunity, but e can still set emself up for a later shot at a
Transparent
Ribbon if e prefers.]
