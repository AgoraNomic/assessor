Amend Crystals (Rule 2685) by replacing:
"The Geologist is a sortitioned office that tracks crystals."
with:
"Crystals are untracked."
and replacing:
"Once a quarter, the Geologist CAN (and SHALL during its first
      Eastman week) publish a Notice of Crystal Growth, upon which each
      crystal whose identity is not equal to the ID of any rule in the
      current ruleset has its size increased by 3."
with:
"At the beginning of each quarter, all crystals whose identity is not equal
to the ID of any rule in the current ruleset has its size increased by 3."

If this proposal is democratic, repeal Crystals (Rule 2685).
