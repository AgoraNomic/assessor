Amend the rule entitled "Ministries" by changing the text
"Interest is an office switch" to read "Interest is secured office switch".

Amend the rule entitled "Proposal Classes" by changing the text
"an untracked Class switch" to read "a secured untracked Class switch".

Amend the rule entitled "Proposal Chambers" by changing the text
"Chamber is an untracked ordinary proposal switch" to read
"Chamber is a secured untracked ordinary proposal switch".

[As is, a power 1 proposal can flip interest, giving a certain officer

dictatorship. The others are secured out of an abundance of caution.]
