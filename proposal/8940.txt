Uh oh, gotta submit something!
Gotta get those proposal points CA-CHING!
(Never let the proposal pool be bare,
lest me be no worse than a simple chair.)

Amend "Welcome Packages" (Rule 2499) by appending
{
- 20 dollaries
}
to the list of assets.

(I remember joining in the middle of a race and decided not to
play for this race, which... is still the current race.
I also would like everyone to consider repealing racing in general,
as I don't see many players taking weekly race actions other
than ais523 and snail...
but that is a separate story.)
