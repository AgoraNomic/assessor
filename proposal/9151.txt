[Creates a stone that follows other stones around]

Amend rule 2645 (The Stones) by adding, at the end, to the list of stones:

       - Sheep Stone (monthly): This stone has no effect. Whenever
         the Sheep Stone is not immune and another stone is transferred
         from owner X to owner Y, where X is the current owner of the
         Sheep Stone, then the Sheep Stone is immediately transferred
         to owner Y as well. When this occurs, the stone cost of the
         Sheep Stone is set to its default value.
