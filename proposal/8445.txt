[It's been bothering me for years that it takes a full proposal to fix
an incorrect title. This would simplify that in obvious cases, and is
pretty safe given that titles are non-substantive (while this
could interfere with a proposal, cleanings can already do
that.)]

Amend Rule 2221, "Cleanliness", by adding as a new paragraph:

  Any player CAN refile a rule without objection, specifying a new
  title; the rule is retitled to the specified title by this rule.

Retitle Rule 2221 to "Cleanliness and Tidy Filing"
