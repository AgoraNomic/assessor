Amend Rule 2577 ("Asset Actions") by replacing "A fixed asset is one
defined as such by its backing document, and CANNOT be transferred; any
other asset is liquid." with "A fixed asset is one defined as such by
its backing document, and CANNOT be transferred except as explicitly
specified by its backing document; any other asset is liquid."

[Brings the definition of "fixed" in line with the definition of
"indestructible" as a way to mean "the default doesn't apply" without
making it completely untransferable.]
