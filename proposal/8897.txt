Amend R2645 by replacing the paragraph that starts with "-Hot Potato
Stone" to read in full:

       - Hot Potato Stone (Weekly, 5):  When this stone is wielded, the
         wielder gains 5 points, every other player who has wielded it
         since Agora last owned it gains 1 point, and it is transferred
         to the specified eligible player. An eligible player is one who
         has not owned this stone since the last time Agora owned it. If
         this  stone is not owned by Agora, it cannot otherwise be
         transferred, other rules notwithstanding. Wielders are
         ENCOURAGED to list all previous wielders. This stone is immune
         if 3 or more players have wielded it since the most recent
         collection notice.
