Amend Rule 649, "Patent Titles", by removing the paragraph:

  If a player publicly petitions that the Herald award a patent
  title to another player for a specified reason, the Herald SHALL
  respond in a timely fashion by either attempting to grant an
  appropriate patent title or explaining publicly why no patent
  title is warranted.

Amend Rule 2143, "Official Reports and Duties", by appending as a new paragraph
at the end:

  If an office has a discretionary power, and a player publicly petitions
  the officer to apply that power in a specific case or manner, the officer
  SHALL publicly respond in a timely fashion.

[No reason this should be specific to Herald (yes, I know I added it in the
first place), and it seems like a good convention to have. It could be
applied to regulations and memoranda, for instance.]
