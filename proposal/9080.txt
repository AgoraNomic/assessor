Re-enact rule 417, with the following text: {
The Archivist is an office; its holder is responsible for ensuring
the continued availability of documents of historical interest.

The archivist’s monthly report contains:
  * Instructions for accessing collections of:
    * Texts of each historic rule revision.
    * Texts of each proposal.
    * Judicial cases.
    * Public messages.
    * Messages to discussion fora.
    * Theses for which a person was awarded a degree.
    * Optionally, any other documents the Archivist deems worthy
      of archival.
  * A description of the completeness of each of the above
    collections.

The referenced collections NEED NOT be perfectly complete or
accurate, but the Archivist SHOULD work towards improving
their completeness and accuracy.
}

Re-title rule 417 to “The Archivist”.

Amend Rule 2581 by appending the following item to the list: {
- Archaeologist, awardable by the Archivist to any player who
  makes a significant contribution to filling in missing
  historical records.
}

Make Gaelan the Archivist.

defer to existing archives - for example that maintained by the
CotC - where appropriate.]
