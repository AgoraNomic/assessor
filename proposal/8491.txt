Title: Minor Speaker fix
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: ATMunn

Amend Rule 103 "The Speaker" by appending the following sentence to
the paragraph beginning "If the office of Speaker has been held
continuously":
  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the Speaker CANNOT object to
  an intent by any player to do so.

  [Explanation: Currently, if the Speaker has been Speaker for at least
  90 days, e can be replaced with support. However, the Speaker has
  the power to stop any intent, even one that is with support, by
  objecting to it. This would mean that the Speaker cannot be removed by
  this method. The office can still be reappointed by the Prime Minister
  if another player wins the game, but as is, the 90+ days method is
  relatively obsolete. The fix is to either remove the feature
  altogether or fix it, and I think it's a nice feature, so I proposed
  this fix. I've also just managed to make an explanation about 3 times
  as long as the actual proposal. Oops.]
