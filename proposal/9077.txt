[Makes it so crystals can't be destroyed by the player that owns them,
which doesn't seem fun. Also gets rid of the "repeal this rule once someone
wins" part since we can just do that by proposal if we want. I'd rather it
stay around by default.]

Amend Rule 2685 (Crystals) by replacing

{
A crystal is an asset with secured integer switches identity, size
      (default 0), and instability (default 0).
}

with

{
A crystal is an indestructible asset with secured integer switches
identity, size
      (default 0), and instability (default 0).
}

and by replacing

{
      Any player CAN, by announcement, Shatter the System, specifying
      each crystallized player, and provided that no player has done so
      in the past 30 days. When a player does so, each crystallized
      player wins the game.

      If at least 4 days have passed since any player won the game in
      this manner, any player CAN repeal this rule by announcement.
}

with

{
      Any player CAN, by announcement, Shatter the System, specifying
      at least 1 crystallized player, and provided that no person has done
so
      in the past 30 days. When a player does so, each crystallized
      player wins the game.

      If a player won the game in this manner 4 days ago, then all existing
      crystals are destroyed.
}
