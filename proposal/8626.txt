[ COMMENT: The gist of this idea is that players can choose for some
   part of their messages which actions should succeed and which actions
   should fail. Hopefully, this would be integrated gracefully into the
   rest of the rules, but that's a lot of SHALLs to sort through to
   decide which should be scoped actions. Comments can be found
   throughout.

   Second update: I've reworked some of the wording. There might still be
   room for breaking. Feel free to tell me to fix it. ]

Enact a new Power=3 rule entitled "Scopes" with text:

  Players CAN take actions in a specific scope. When a player does
  so, e must either clearly and unambiguously describe a list of
  allowed actions or a list of prohibited actions for that scope, or
  e must refer to a source which clearly and unambiguously defines
  such a list. E must also clearly and unambiguously specify when e
  begins acting in that scope and when e finishes acting in that
  scope.

  Actions within a scope which are prohibited or not allowed are
  blocked actions, while actions which are allowed or not prohibited
  are unblocked actions.

[ COMMENT: I'm not sure what I think of this terminology. ]

  When a player is acting within a specific scope, if an action
  which would otherwise succeed is blocked within that scope, then
  that action instead fails.

  When a player begins acting in a scope, e CAN specify which
  of the following modifiers apply, if any.

  * Indirection allowed: actions within this scope whose end results
    are solely to initiate one or more unblocked actions within this
    scope succeed as well.

  * Partial success prohibited: if one action within this scope
    would fail, then all actions within the scope fail.

  * Acting on behalf allowed: acting on behalf to perform an
    unblocked action within this scope succeeds as well.

[ COMMENT: There's got to be a way to phrase these scope modifiers
   better, right? ]

  The following scopes are defined:

[ COMMENT: These are just random suggestions , though I think they are
   useful. Feel free to suggest more. ]

  * Global scope: all actions are allowed in this scope.

[ COMMENT: This should also allow players to say something like "I act
   in the global scope, disallowing partial success, to do the following:
   {...}" instead of "If all the following succeed I do this: {...}".
   I think that it's elegant, if a bit wordy. Suggestions for better
   terminology for scopes are welcome. ]

  * Transaction scope: when acting in this scope, only transfers of
    assets are allowed.
  * Economic scope: when acting in this scope, creation,
    destruction, and transfers of assets are allowed.
  * Official scope: for a specified office, only actions mandated by
    the rules for that office succeed.

[ COMMENT: This is a rather broad specification, but it might allow us
   to write something like "When the rules say an Officer CAN do
   something, then e does so in that Office's scope", though whether we
   want to is another question. ]

[ COMMENT: So what do you think? I like the idea, but executing actions
   within a scope is wordy. As is the proposed rule. With no comments,
   it's still over 40 lines long. Suggestions to make either more
   succinct are very welcome. ]
