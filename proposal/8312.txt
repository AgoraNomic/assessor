Enact a new power-1 rule entitled "Default Mechanisms" reading as follows:
{
  If the Rules other than this one, as a whole, provide that a person CAN
  perform an action, but do not state the mechanism by which e can do so, e
  CAN perform it by announcement.

  If the Rules other than this one, as a whole, provide that a non-person
  entity CAN perform an action, but do not state the mechanism by which e can
  do so, any person CAN cause that entity to perform that action with Agoran
  Consent.

  If the Rules other than this one, as a whole, provide that an action CAN be
  performed but do not specify any entities as being capable of performing
  that action, any person CAN perform that action with Agoran Consent.

  For the purposes of this Rule, the Rules provide a mechanism for an action
  to be performed even if they specify a mechanism with a precondition which
  is not currently met, and they specify that an entity can perform that
  action even if no appropriate entity currently exists. This Rule defers to
  all Rules which permit actions to be performed by specific mechanisms.
}
