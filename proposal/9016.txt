If a rule named "Laserwort" exists, then do all of the following:
{

Amend the rule titled "Laserwort" by replacing "ownership wholly
restricted to players and Agora" with "ownership wholly restricted to
players, Agora, and the Flower Pot".

Enact a rule with title "Rafflesia Reclamation", Power 1, and the text:

{{

   Rafflesia is a currency with ownership wholly restricted to players
and Agora and is tracked by the Florist. If any amount of Rafflesia
would be in abeyance, it is destroyed instead.

   The Flower Pot is an entity that holds laserwort as the winning pool
for raffles.

   Any player CAN pay 2 laserwort to the Flower Pot to buy a ticket,
creating a Rafflesia in eir possession. The Florist CAN do so on behalf
of Agora, and SHOULD whenever Agora does not own any Rafflesia.

   The Florist CAN by announcement close the raffle, provided that
raffle has not been closed this month, randomly selecting a player or
Agora, weighted proportionally to the number of Rafflesia e owns (or, if
no Rafflesia exists, selecting Agora with probability 1). When e does
so, one-half (rounded up) of the laserwort owned by the Flower Pot are
transferred to the selected entity, then the remaining amount is
transferred to Agora, then all Rafflesia are destroyed.

   If any Rafflesia exist at the beginning of each month and there has
continuously existed at least some Rafflesia since the beginning of the
month, the Florist SHALL close the raffle in a timely fashion after the
beginning of the month.

   If the amount of laserwort that exists is greater than the stock, the
Florist SHOULD encourage players to buy a ticket or otherwise
incentivise players to buy a ticket.
