Create a rule titled "Hectares" with this text:

       Hectare is a type of fixed asset, tracked by the Land Managor.

       A player CAN pay a fee of 500 Pyrite to gain 1 Hectare.

Amend Rule 2499 (Welcome Packages) by adding this item to the list:

       * 16 Hectares.

Each player gains 16 Hectares.

Amend the rule titled "The Growth Cycle" by replacing the first
paragraph with:

       A player CAN plant an in-season Crop by paying a fee in Pyrite
       equal to its Seed Cost, provided that eir number of Hectares is
       greater than the number of Crops e planted earlier in the current
       Crop Season and has not yet harvested.
