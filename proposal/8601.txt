Amend Rule 2492 (Recusal) by replacing this text:

  If a judge is recused from a case 4+ days after being assigned to
  it, e SHOULD NOT be assigned as a judge until e has apologised and
  or reasonably explained eir actions.

with this text:

  If a judge is recused from a case that was continuously open and
  assigned to em for at least the past 4 days, e SHOULD NOT be
  assigned as a judge until e has apologised and/or reasonably
  explained eir actions.

[Not that it affects CFJ 3922, but this would prevent the rule from
targeting situations like:
   * Aug 22, player is assigned to a case
   * Aug 23, player judges the case
   * Aug 27, other players move to reconsider the case
   * Aug 28, player recuses emself: only 1 day after e was last assigned,
       but 6 days after e was originally assigned]
