Janet's Ultraviolet Ribbon Ownership is hereby flipped to true.

[

I won by points at
https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-business/2023-March/050699.html

Champion was awarded at
https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-business/2023-March/050704.html

After that, I just forgot to award myself the ribbon apparently? It's
too late to claim it normally now, so I'm asking for it with this
proposal. I recognize this is my own fault, so I won't be upset if this
fails.

I have pledged not to claim radiance award for this proposal, and this
proposal isn't otherwise for gameplay advantage besides having the
ribbon. (I also already have Transparent.)
