If RadicalRose is not a player, then the rest of this proposal has no
effect.

Create 10 spendies in RadicalRose's possession.

For each of the following assets:

   * 1 nix stamp
   * 1 RadicalRose stamp
   * 1 RadicalRose stamp

if the Lost and Found Department owns an instance of it, then transfer
one instance of it from the Lost and Found Department to RadicalRose;
otherwise, create an instance in RadicalRose's possession.

[Restore RR's assets prior to improper deregistration, after deducting
  the contents of a Welcome Package.]
