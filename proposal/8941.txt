Enact the following rule:

{

Asceticism is a negative boolean person switch tracked by the Herald. A
player with an Asceticism of true is an Ascetic.


A player CAN by announcement flip their Asceticism to a specified valid
value if e has not done so in the previous 30 days.


If an Ascetic's radiance is greater than from what eir radiance was when e
most recently became an Ascetic, it is immediately set to that value.


Once per week, an Ascetic CAN Meditate by announcement. When e does so, e
gains 2 stamp of eir own type if e most recently became an Ascetic more
than 30 days ago; otherwise, e gains 1 stamp of eir own type.

}
