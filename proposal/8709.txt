Title: Promises Any vs Each
Adoption index: 2.2
Author: snail

Amend Rule 2618 (Promises) by replacing "provided that any conditions for
cashing it specified by its text are unambiguously met" with "provided that
each condition for cashing it specified by its text is unambiguously met"

[prevents a reading of only some of the cashing conditions needing to be
met
since that would be "any" conditions]
