Amend Rule 2672 (Weekly Race Action) by replacing

       "get a jersey for a specified horse by paying 1 hoof, also
specifying a horse which is thereby added to that horse's pull, by paying 1
hoof."

with

       "get a jersey for a specified horse, also specifying a horse which
is thereby added to that horse's pull, by paying 1 hoof."

[The last fix made a bug so here's a fix for the bug fix bug.]
