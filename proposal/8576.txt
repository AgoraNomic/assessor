Title: "By announcement" loosening
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet

Amend Rule 478 by replacing the following:

{

  Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
  announcement", that person performs that action by unambiguously and
  clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs it.

}

with the following:

{

  Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
  announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single public
  message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to perform that
  action by sending that message, doing both clearly and unambiguously.

}


[This unambiguously makes "CFJ: X" and "Proposal: X" work, even though
neither explicitly says they are performing an action, since they both
clearly and unambiguously set forth intent to perform the associated
action. The "by sending that message" part was suggested by Aris, and
prevents "I want to CFJ X at some point" from accidentally taking an
action, even though it arguably sets forth intent to initiate a CFJ.
This also brings the standard for "by announcement" in line with
initiating a decision and casting a ballot, which both require a notice
that "sets forth intent".]
