Amend Rule 2422 by deleting the following text:

{

  A player CAN Buy Strength by paying a fee of 1 Extra Vote. A player's
  Voting Strength on an ordinary referendum is 1 greater for every time e
  Bought Strength during that decision's voting period.

}


Enact a new Rule entitled "Buying Strength" with power 2 and text as
follows:

{

  A player CAN Buy Strength by paying a fee of 1 Extra Vote. A player's
  Voting Strength on referendum on an ordinary proposal is 1 greater for
  every time e Bought Strength during that decision's voting period.

}


[Fixes the ambiguity that ais523 pointed out, and also removes the usage
of the undefined term "ordinary referendum", replacing it with the
well-defined but clunky "referendum on an ordinary proposal".]
