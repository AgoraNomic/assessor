Amend Rule 2555 (Blots) by inserting the following paragraph after the
paragraph beginning "Levying fines and destroying blots":

  A person CAN, by announcement, create a specified number of blots in
  eir possession.

Amend Rule 2535 (Zombies) by inserting the following list item before
the item that says "deregister.":

  - create blots;

[This is intended to allow contracts to provide enforcement mechanisms
other than R1742's general "SHALL act in accordance with that contract".
For example, a contract could grant an Enforcer the ability to act on
behalf of other parties to create blots in the possession of the other
party. This could also, potentially, reduce work on the Referee.

The zombie provision is intended to prevent zombie owners from screwing
over their zombies.]
