Amend Rule 879 (Quorum) by changing its power to 3.

[the basic definition of quorum should be power-3 along with the rest of
voting, right?]


Amend Rule 879 (Quorum) by replacing:
  As an exception to the previous paragraph, the quorum of an
  Agoran decision can never be less than 2. If the rules would
  attempt to set the quorum of an Agoran decision to less than 2,
  it is set to 2 instead.
with:
  As an exception to the previous paragraph, the minimum quorum of
  an Agoran decision is 2, or 1 if there are fewer than 2 players in
  the game. If the rules would attempt to set the quorum of an Agoran
  decision to less than the minimum quorum, it is set to the minimum
  instead.

[If 1 person is the only player, that should be quorum.  Less than 1 is
game-breaking trouble, so minimum=1 protects extra against the final
deregistration]
