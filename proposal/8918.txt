Enact a rule with power=1.0 entitled "Ritual Paper Dance" and the text:
{
Firstly: Each of these is a ritual act:
- Performing a cabinet order
- Assigning a judgement
- Awarding ribbons
- Once per week per report type, publishing a report
- Once per week per player, nominating for office
- Once per week per player, voting

Secondly: Once for each ritual act, any player, including the player
who performed the ritual act, CAN, by announcement, declare the ritual
number. A ritual number is a number that starts at 0, and can be at
most 1 greater than any other declared ritual number. Declared ritual
numbers are self-ratifying.

Thirdly: Once, each time a unique positive multiple of 41 is declared,
in the same message the declarer CAN, by announcement, have qualifying
players lift The First Speaker in a powerful dance around the fountain,
while also announcing that those players' gain 1 radiance, in such a
way that is unambiguous and clear, so that in fact, those players' do
gain 1 radiance. This does not increase their radiance by 2, nor does
it increase it by 3 or 4. 5 is right out.

Fourthly: Players are qualifying under this rule if:
- they are active
- do not have the highest radiance
- are not tied for the highest radiance
}

(Glitter) Also snail and Janet gain 1 radiance.
(something about co-authorship should be taken seriously but these
players still helped!)
