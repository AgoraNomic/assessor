Enact a new rule with title "Fixing the very fair rule" and the text:
If a rule called "Very fair rule" is in the ruleset, then:
- Everyone has the role "The player secretsnail". Once a player wins, they
lose this role.

This rule explicitly takes precedence over the rule called "Very fair rule".
After "Very fair rule" is repealed, or after it is not in any current
proposals, repeal this rule the next day.
By Agoran Consent, a player can repeal "Very fair rule".
