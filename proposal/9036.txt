Title: AI security revisited
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: ais523


Amend R1607 by replacing "A referendum is the Agoran decision to
determine whether to adopt a proposal." with "A referendum is the Agoran
decision to determine whether to adopt a proposal (its associated
proposal)."

[Define this undefined term.]


Amend Rule 1950 by, as a single amendment:

{

Deleting "If a referendum has an adoption index less than the adoption
index of its associated proposal, the referendum's adoption index is
immediately set to that of the associated proposal".

Then, inserting the following paragraph after the first paragraph:

{

The adoption index of a referendum CANNOT be set or changed to "none" or
to a value less than that of its associated proposal. If a referendum
ever has an adoption index of "none" or an adoption index less than that
of its associated proposal, it is immediately set to the adoption index
of the associated proposal.

}

}

[Prevent a low-powered rule from attempting to continuously set the
value of an AI, causing it to perhaps become indeterminate.]
