Title: auctions have fees

[The payment rule for auctions just says that if you happen to have an
auction debt, if you pay Agora under any circumstances, it triggers
stuff.  This means, if someone happens to have two auction debts, they
can make one payment and it would count for both.  This brings things
into line.]

Amend Rule 2551 (Auction End) by replacing:
  The winner of a lot SHALL pay the Auctioneer the number of the
  Auction's currency equal to eir bid, in a single payment, in a
  timely fashion.
with:
  The winner of the lot SHALL, in a timely fashion, pay a fee (the
  number of the Auction's currency equal to eir bid) to the
  Auctioneer in order to satisfy eir auction debt.

[This makes "satisfying eir auction debt" a fee-based action governed
under R2579, which didn't exist when the auction rules were written.
R2579 then takes care of the various CANs and method details.  The
transfer of the lots is then a consequence of "satisfying eir auction
debt"].
