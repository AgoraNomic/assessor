Amend rule 2690 (Spendies) by replacing the sentence reading:

       At the beginning of each month, every player is granted 20
       Spendies.

with:

       At the beginning of each month, every player is granted 5 + N
       Spendies, where N is the lesser of 20 or the total number of
       times that players contributed to anti-pirate defense in the
       previous month.

and appending at the end of that rule, as a new paragraph:

       A player may contribute to anti-pirate defense by paying a fee
       of 5 Spendies.
