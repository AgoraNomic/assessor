Set Rule 2141's power to 3.1

[Rationale: Rule 2141 (Role and Attributes of Rules) defines
(unsurprisingly) what rules are and what they can do. This is
sufficiently important that it should take precedence over other power-3
rules. This doesn't protect it from power-3 instruments (since nothing
can), but it does help it from accidentally losing a precedence battle,
especially with its relatively high ID number.]
