[I used "Artistry" rather than "Art" to distinguish it from references
to the liberal arts. Later, I realized that those references use
"Arts" as in "Bachelor of Arts". So we're fine to just use Art here.]

Amend Rule 1367, "Degrees", by replacing each instance of "Artistry"
with "Art".

Change each instance of the patent title "Associate of Nomic
Artistry" to "Associate of Nomic Arts".
