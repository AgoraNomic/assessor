Title: Predictable Judicial Timelines
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: Kate
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 591 ("Delivering Judgements") by replacing "in a timely
fashion" with "in an officially timely fashion".

Comment: This moves CFJ deadlines to always be at the end of an Agoran
week, hopefully ensuring judges are less frequently caught by surprise
even if the Arbitor does not perform eir duties at the same time every
week.
