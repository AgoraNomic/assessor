[Right now, sentences like "Blank are an asset ownable by..." is
interpreted to adding to a default within R2576. This seems unintuitive.
This proposal makes that default only apply if there's no mention of
ownership.]

Amend R2576 (Ownership) by replacing:

    If ownership of an asset is restricted to a class of entities, then
    that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity outside
    that class. By default, ownership of an asset is restricted to
    Agora, players, and contracts, but an asset's backing document may
    modify this.

with:

    An asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity unless its
    backing document specifies that entity can own it. If an asset's
    backing document is otherwise silent on which entities can own it,
    then it can be owned by Agora, players, and contracts.

Amend R2659 (Stamps) by replacing:

    Stamps are a category of asset ownable by players .

with:

    Stamps are a category of asset ownable by players and Agora.
