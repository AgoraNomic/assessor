Amend Rule 1728 (Tabled Actions) by replacing the paragraph beginning "A
person CAN act" with the following:

{

A person, acting as emself, CAN by announcement table an intent (syn.
"intend") to perform a tabled action, clearly, conspicuously,
explicitly, and without obfuscation specifying the action, the method
(including non-default parameter values), and, optionally, conditions.
The clarity requirement in this paragraph is to be interpreted so as to
impose the highest possible communication standard on intents.

}


[Add "clearly" and "explicitly" to the tabled action clarity
requirement, and make it explicit in the rule that the requirement is
not to be weakened by judges.]
