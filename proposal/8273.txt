Title: Clean up your own mess, without making a bigger one
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Gaelan

Remove the following paragraph from Rule 2139 “The Registrar”: {
  The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches,
  defined in a rule, that would otherwise lack an officer to track
  them, unless the switch is defined as untracked.
}

Create a power-1 rule titled “Switch Responsibility” with the following text: {
  For each type of switch which would otherwise lack an officer to track it,
  and is not defined as untracked, there exists an imposed office named
  “Tracker of [switch name]” that is responsible for tracking that switch.
}

[1006/44 states:
    When a proposal takes effect and creates a new office, if the
    proposal does not specify otherwise, the author of that proposal
    becomes the holder of the office.

I think this works, but we might need to clarify the meaning of
“creates a new office” to be sure.]
