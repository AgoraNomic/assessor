[The normal standard set by CFJ 1905 is "a message has not been sent via
  a forum until most persons who have arranged to receive messages via
  the forum receive it". This is a sensible place to draw the line, but
  verifying that for a whole set of messages is arguably more trouble
  than it's worth. AFAIK no scams were attempted, apart from a Win by
  Apathy that was already objected to; and even once we verify that a
  message was received by enough people, we still have to keep track of
  which of those messages have or haven't already been verified.

H. Distributor omd advises that the problems started on Dec 14, so this
includes all messages from the a-o and a-b archives from Dec 13 onward.]

Ratify the following ~~~-delimited document:

~~~
Each of the following messages was effectively sent to the Public Forum
on or about the Date: stamp shown in the archives. Claims within these
messages (in particular, claims to perform actions) may still be
ineffective for other reasons.
