[ COMMENT: Introduces a new term of art so that we don't have to worry
   about messing up the wording for giving a birthday gift again. ]

Amend Rule 2585 "Birthday Gifts" by replacing:

  During a player's Agoran Birthday and the 7 days following, each
  other player CAN once grant em X boatloads of coins by
  announcement, where X is 3 if it is actually the day of the
  player's birthday, and 2 otherwise.
