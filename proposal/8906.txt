Title: Stone Immunity Correction (Keeping Our Stones) Act
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet

[Restore the definition of immunity, and add security to it.]

Amend Rule 2643 ("Collecting Stones") by prepending the following paragraph:

{

A stone is immune if and only if it is defined as such by the rules of
power not less than 2.

A stone is immune if it is owned by Agora. A stone is immune if it has
been granted immunity since the last collection notice. The granting of
immunity is secured.

}


[Explicitly prohibit the Soul Stone from transferring stones owned by
Agora. This isn't technically needed with the previous change, but it's
better to just make it explicit to prevent accidentally it breaking
again in the future.]

Amend Rule 2645 ("The Stones") by replacing "When wielded, the Soul
Stone is transferred to the owner of a different specified non-immune
stone, then that stone is transferred to the wielder." with "When
wielded, the Soul Stone is transferred to the owner of a different
specified non-immune stone not owned by Agora, then that stone is
transferred to the wielder.".


[Disallow theft of Protected stones, and add a tiebreak.]

Amend Rule 2645 ("The Stones") by replacing the list item beginning
"Anti-Equatorial" with the following

{

- Anti-Equatorial Stone (Monthly, 5): When wielded, the mossiest
non-immune stone is transferred to the wielder. If more than one such
stone is tied for mossiest, a specified one is transferred. When this
happens, the Anti-Equatorial Stone's mossiness is incremented by 1.

}
