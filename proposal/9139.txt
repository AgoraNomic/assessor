[Under the current rules, whenever the Protection Stone is protecting
itself
and ends up in Agora's possession, it's stuck there permanently.]

Amend rule 2640 (Stones) by replacing

       A stone is immune if and only if a rule of power 2 or more says it
       is immune; otherwise it is non-immune.

with:

       A stone is immune if and only if a rule of power 2 or more says it
       is immune and it is not owned by Agora; otherwise it is non-immune.
