If Proposal 8291 has been passed, and Rule 2350 does not have the list
item "* A chamber to which the proposal shall be assigned upon it
creation.", add that list item to the end of the list. If the list
item is present, but it is not at the end of the list, or it is
unclear or otherwise difficult or impossible to determine where in the
list it is, put it at the end of the list.
