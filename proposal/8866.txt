Title: Restricted confederation
Adoption index: 3.0

Amend Rule 869 by replacing "Any entity (including a group of
confederated entities)" with "Any entity (including a group of entities
confederated with the intent of forming a single person under this Rule)".

[Requires intent for the formation of a group person. This prevents a
random group of people confederated for some other purpose (the example
initially raised was BlogNomic, or its set of players) from being
treated as a group person, unless they also wish to confederate for the
purposes of Agora.]
