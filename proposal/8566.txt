Title: Anti-AI escalation
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: 


Amend rule 1950 by appending the following to the first paragraph: " If
a referendum has an adoption index less than the adoption index of its
associated proposal, the referendum's adoption index is immediately set
to that of the associated proposal".

[Prevents a potential 2->3 power escalation where a Power 2 dictatorship
can set the AI of the referendum on an AI 3 proposal to 1, then force it
through at AI 1.]
