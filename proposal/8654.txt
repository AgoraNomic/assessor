[
- clarifies timing of JC grant paragraph
- the default penalty is 2 blots.  a set-complete JC removes 2.5
  blots.  A perp shouldn't profit from their crime by pointing
  at themselves and getting a JC for it.  So this removes self-points
  from the counting.

Amend Rule 2478 (Vigilante Justice) by replacing:
  The player who initiated the most Finger Pointings that resulted
  in a Warning, Indictment, or Cold Hand of Justice in the previous
  Agoran Week CAN once grant emself a Justice Card by announcement.
with:
  The player who initiated the most Finger Pointings at other
  players that, in the previous Agoran Week, resulted
  in a Warning, Indictment, or Cold Hand of Justice, CAN once
  grant emself a Justice Card by announcement.
