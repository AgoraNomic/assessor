Title: Deputisation fix

Amend Rule 2160 ("Deputisation") by replacing the text "acting on eir
own behalf" with the text "acting as emself".

[Per CFJ 2637, taking actions within a public message is not acting on
the behalf of oneself, so it may currently be impossible to deputise
without some shenanigans. "Acting as emself" appears to be the standard
way of phrasing this requirement.]
