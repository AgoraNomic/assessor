Amend Rule 2579 by replacing the first three paragraphs with the following:

{

  If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter the fee for
  the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing an action, that
  method for performing that action is a fee-based method.

  If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a fungible asset, the actual fee
  is the next highest integer amount of that asset.

  To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
  permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing the
  action; the announcement must specify the correct set of assets for the
  fee and indicate intent to pay that fee for the sole purpose of using
  that method to perform that action.

}

and replacing the final paragraph with the following:

{

  If a fee-based method to perform an action has a fee of no assets, that
  action CAN be performed by announcement, but the actor SHOULD announce
  that there was a 0 or empty fee.

}


[Inspired by Falsifian pointing out that winning the game is/was a
fee-based action, which might have meant that all attempts to win the
game required a fee. This removes actions being fee-based and instead
makes methods fee-based. This change is also designed to keep all
protections and (hopefully) protect existing precedent for fee-based
actions.]
