Amend R2478, "Vigilante Justice" by adding to the beginning of the
list:

  - Issuing a Warning to the perp, as described elsewhere;

and by adding after the list items:

  Initiating a Finger Pointing found to be Shenanigans is ILLEGAL
  and the Class 0+N Crime of Unjustified Gesticulation, where N is
  the number of times e has previously committed the crime in the
  current Agoran Week.

and by adding, to the very end of the rule:

  The player who initiated the most Finger Pointings that resulted
  in a Warning, Indictment, or Cold Hand of Justice in the previous
  Agoran Week CAN once grant emself a Justice Card by announcement.

Amend R2557 "Sentencing Guidelines" by adding to the end:

  When the rules authorize an investigator to issue a Warning for a
  violation, e CAN do so by announcement if the violation is
  described by the rules as a "Class N Crime" where N is 0 or an
  expression that evaluates to 0.

[There is no ruleset support for class 0 crimes right now. So this
version adds support by introducing a new thing the investigator can do
called a Warning.]
