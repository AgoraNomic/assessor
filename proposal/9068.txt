//Comment:  This subgame is a very rule-light and
experimental worldbuilding game that is officerless but CfJ-reliant (so I
encourage people to take into account the Arbitor's opinion on this). I
intend to play as some fantasy race and progress my civilization one step
at a time but feel free to play in any way you want - what goes and doesn't
will ultimately depend on our collective CfJs.

Create a new Power-1 rule called "Agora of Empires" with this content:

"There exists a document known as the Empireworld, which should describe in
some way a fictional world. Each player that has amended this document is
said to have their own Empire in the Empireworld, and such players are
Imperials.

A player CAN amend the Empireworld once per week by announcement to
narratively progress the Empireworld in some reasonable fashion. The
message with this kind of announcement MUST include the latest form of the
Empireworld post-amendment. These amendments MUST follow relevant guidance
given in CfJs. Imperials are ENCOURAGED to shape this subgame through CfJs.

Any person can amend the Empireworld without 2 objections and Imperials are
ENCOURAGED to attempt this action when ey believe it to be appropriate.

An Imperial can, by announcement, win the game without 2 objections if the
Empireworld shows that ey have accomplished at least 3 extraordinary feats
in the fictional world that the Empireworld describes since ey last won the
game in this way. This rule does not describe what qualifies as an
extraordinary feat."
