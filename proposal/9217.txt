[Provides a mechanism to slowly ratchet up the pressure. The delay is
deliberately designed to avoid giving an advantage to someone who both
orders ammo and loads a round right before the end of a week.]

Amend rule 2696 (Bang actions) by adding at the end:

       A player may order more ammo by announcement if both of the
       following are true: the match state is ongoing and has not
       changed in the past 21 days; and no one has ordered more ammo in
       the current or prior week. When a player orders more ammo, at the
       end of the following week each alive player gains one bang.
