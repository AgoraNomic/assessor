Amend Rule 2691 ("Sortition Procedure") by, as a single amendment:

* Replacing "CAN become an option for that office" with "CAN by
announcement become an option for that office".

* Replacing "that player becomes the officeholder for that office" with
"that player becomes the officeholder for that office, then the
sortition ends"

* Inserting the following paragraph after the paragraph beginning "Seven
days after":

{

If a sortition's lots period has ended, and the sortition has no valid
options, then it immediately ends with no selection, and any duty to
select an option with respect to it is discharged.

}


Each ongoing sortition that is not in its lots period and that has no
valid options or has previously had an option selected hereby ends.
