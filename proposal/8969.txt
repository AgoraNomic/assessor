/* Comment: This is intended to be a game that intends to be a very
simplified, "arcade" version of a nomic that is entirely dominated by the
overwhelming power of proposals, rather than the rules and subgames they
create. Rice is a stand-in for any sort of point/resource/power/achievement
score or tally, Rice Plans are stand-ins for Proposals, Signatures are
stand-ins for votes. */

Create a rule called "The Rice Game" at Power 1, and the following text:
{
The Ricemastor is an office, in charge of tracking Rice, Rice Plans and
Signatures. Rice is a fixed asset, ownable only by players. Any active
player can create a Rice Plan by announcement, if e hasn't done so yet in
the current week. Rice Plans can have Signatures, and each Signature must
be of an active player. A Rice Plan has an active player's Signature as
long as that player is consenting to it. An active player can destroy a
Rice Plan that e has created by announcement.

A Harvest occurs at the beginning of each week. When this occurs:
- If there is only one Rice Plan with the most Signatures, that Rice Plan
is Harvested.
- If there is more than one Rice Plan with the most Signatures, the one
that was created earliest is Harvested.
- In all other cases, nothing happens.
And then all Rice Plans are destroyed and the Harvest ends.

Rice Plans consist of two lists of players, with each list having no
repeated players, and the lists can be empty. One of these lists is its
Rice Up list, and the other is its Rice Down list. When a Rice Plan is
Harvested, for each player listed in its Rice Up list, if that player is
active, e gains 1 Rice; and for each player listed in its Rice Down list,
if e has at least 1 Rice then e lose 1 Rice.

If after a Harvest there is a single active player with at least 2 Rice and
more Rice than any other player, then that player wins the game, and all
Rice is destroyed. When the game has been won in this manner three times,
this rule repeals itself.
}

Yachay becomes the Ricemastor.
