Title: Schrodinger's report
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Murphy

Amend Rule 2480 (Festivals) by replacing this text:

  While Agora's Festivity is 0, Festivity is tracked in the
  Tailor's monthly report. Otherwise, it is tracked in the
  Tailor's weekly report.

with this text:

  Festivity is tracked in the Tailor's monthly report. In addition,
  while Festivity is non-zero, the Tailor SHALL announce its value each
  week; a public document purporting to be such an announcement is
  self-ratifying.

[Now that Glitter has been repealed, the existence of the Tailor's
weekly report depends solely on whether a Festival is in progress. I
would rather give up the occasional extra salary than have to deal with
the extra complexity in the ADoP's report.]
