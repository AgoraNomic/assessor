[Spendies drive a number of game mechanics, and radiance drives wins.

This proposal explicitly terminates any ongoing sortition for either
office; R2691 probably does that too, but this is extra assurance.]


Any ongoing sortition for the office of Illuminator or the office of
Spendor immediately ends with no selection; any duty to select an option
with respect to such a sortition is discharged.

Amend rule 2656 (Radiance) by replacing "a sortitioned" with "an"

Amend rule 2690 (Spendies) by replacing "a sortitioned" with "an"
