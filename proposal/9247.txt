Amend Rule 2667 (Succumbing to Time) to read:

       A player CAN Succumb by announcement. Upon doing so, if e has not
       already Succumbed that month, then each of eir deadlines to
       perform an Officer's duty or judge a Call for Judgement is
       extended by 1 day if it would otherwise expire within the next
       week.

[My recordkeeping software currently doesn't check "did this player
  already succumb this month", though I checked the database and didn't
  find any oversights that weren't already corrected. I could get around
  to implementing a check, or alternatively I could make it only matter
  if/when someone actually bothers to note an infraction.]
