Amend R2621, VP Wins, to read in full:

  The Victory Threshold is 20-5x, where x is the number of months
  since the last time someone Took Over The Economy. If it would
  be less, the Victory Threshold is instead 1.

  If a player has at least the Victory Threshold more Victory
  Points than any other player, e CAN Take Over the Economy by
  announcement, provided no person has won the game by doing so in
  the past 30 days.

  When a player takes over the economy, e wins the game. Four days
  after such a win occurs, all Cards and all Products are
  destroyed. Then, each active player gains 1 card of each type
  and eir grant (if any).
