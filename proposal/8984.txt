[The current wording seems to suggest that players should say something
like "I intend to register." While effective, it's quite different than
the conventional way of doing most actions. This version disambiguates
that.]

Amend R869 by replacing:

      An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
      indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
      intends to become a player at that time. No person can be a player
      if e is part of another player or another player is part of em.

with:

      An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
      indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously eir
      desire to become a player at that time (for example, by saying "I
      register"). No person can be a player if e is part of another
      player or another player is part of em.
