[I've gone with making this an "honest" popularity system, not affected
by manipulatable mechanics such as proposal strength.]

Amend the rule entitled "Popular Proposal Proposer Privilege"
by changing it to read in full:

  For an Agoran decision on whether to adopt a proposal, let F be the total
  number of valid ballots resolving to FOR, A be the same for AGAINST,
  and T be the total number of valid ballots. The decision's popularity
  is equal to (F - A)/T. The Assessor SHOULD publish the popularity of each
  decision when resolving it.


  The player who proposed the adopted proposal such that the decision on whether
  to adopt it had the greatest popularity, among all such decisions assessed in
  the last 7 days CAN once earn one Legislative Card by announcement, provided
  that no decision on whether to adopt any proposal distributed in the same
  message remains unresolved. If there is a tie, all authors of the tied
  proposals can do so once each.
