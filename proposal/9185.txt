Amend Rule 2692 ("Bang!") by replacing "When a player stands alone, e
wins the game. If a player won the game in this manner 4 days ago, then
the match state is flipped to none (if it is not already)." with the
following: "When a player stands alone, eir radiance is increased by 30,
then the match state is flipped to none (if it is not already).".

[A full win for this relatively fast (even after the changes) subgame
has always seemed like a lot to me.]
