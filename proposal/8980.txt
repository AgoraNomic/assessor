/* Comment: This is intended to allow players, especially less fluent ones,
to perform (by proxy) actions that they intend to do when they might mess
up the exact wording that they'd need to use to do so. Or, at least, it
adds an explicit flag for review of what they're trying to do and a request
for notification if they've messed up. It's also intended to be very easy
to use, you'd just need to add "I invoke" to a message and you're good to
go.*/

Create the following rule at Power 1 with the title "Invocation":

A player can Invoke by announcement.

When a player Invokes in a message, an attempt to perform an action in that
message is Invocable if all of the following is true:
- Such an attempt has failed to perform an action or it would produce an
effect other than what seems to be its intent.
- Such an attempt is not older than 24 hours.
- Nobody has Responded to that Invocation.
Any player can Respond to the Invocation by acting on the Invoker's behalf
to perform what reasonably would be the intended action of an Invocable
attempt to perform an action.

Players are ENCOURAGED to publicly make it known when an attempt to perform
an action is Invocable, if it hasn't been already.
