[In case the public wants a change but prefers more conventional
vocabulary.]

Amend each of Rule 1023 ("Agoran Time"), Rule 2496 ("Rewards"), and
Rule 2602 ("Glitter"), in that order, by changing each instance of the text
"in an officially timely fashion" or "in a stately fashion"
to read "in a sedate fashion".
