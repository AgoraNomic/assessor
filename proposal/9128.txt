Amend Rule 2644 by replacing the text "all existing stones are
transferred to Agora." with the text "all existing stones are
transferred to Agora, after which the Stone Cost of each stone is set to
its default value.".

For each stone with Stone Cost less than 10, set the Stone Cost of that
stone to 10. [Reset after snail's win.]
