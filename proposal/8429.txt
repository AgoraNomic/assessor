  Optionally, in the same message in which e imposes justice, the
  investigator CAN specify that the violation is forgivable,
  specifying up to 10 words to be included in an apology.  If the
  investigator does so, the perp CAN, in a timely fashion, expunge P
  blots from emself, where P is the minimum of the value of the fine
  and 3, by publishing a formal apology of at least 200 words and
  including all the specified words, explaining eir error, shame,
