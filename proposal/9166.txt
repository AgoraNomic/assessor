Amend Rule 2594 ("Hats") by replacing "Hats are a secured player switch"
with "Hats are a secured untracked player switch" and by replacing the
paragraph beginning "A player CAN change eir hat" with the following
paragraph:

{

A player CAN change eir hat to a valid value by public designation.

}

[Don't require reporting on hats in any event, and don't require
explicit "notification" to any person (in any event, it's unclear what
it means to "notify" oneself).]
