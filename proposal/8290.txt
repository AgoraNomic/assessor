[I went and looked - when we inflated base voting power from 1 to 3,
we kept the range 0-5, so we really deflated the range.  Going with
14, a little less than before].

Amend Rule 2422 (Voting Strength) by replacing:
  The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
  integer between 0 and 5 inclusive
with:
  The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
  integer between 0 and 14 inclusive
