[This gives everyone a bit of warning before someone goes and repeals the
Emergency Regulations, and gives the PM time to potentially extend
the emergency. Note that explicitly specifying the deadline in this rule
means that it can't be extended further.]

Amend the rule entitled "Eclipse Light" by changing the text
  "If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least a month
  and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in the past month, any
  player CAN, by announcement, cause this rule to repeal all Emergency
  Regulations and then itself."
to read
  "If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least a month
  and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in the past month, any
  player CAN, with 7 days notice, cause this rule to repeal all Emergency
  Regulations and then itself."
