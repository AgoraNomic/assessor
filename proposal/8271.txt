[Puts in a time requirement for Doctorates, also fixes bug]


Change the Power of Rule 1367 (Degrees) to 2.
[I've wondered for a while why we need this at 3!]


Amend Rule 1367 (Degrees) by replacing its last paragraph with:
  A specified degree CAN be awarded by any player other than the
  awardee, with 2 Agoran consent.  It SHOULD only be awarded for the
  publication of an original thesis of scholarly worth (including
  responses to peer-review), published with explicit intent to qualify
  for a degree. Any degree with D.N. as part of its abbreviation
  SHOULD take into account the awardee's academic history and participation
  in Agora over time. The Herald SHOULD coordinate the peer-review process
  and the awarding of degrees.
