Enact a new rule with title "Proposal Limits" and the following text:

{

A person SHALL NOT submit a proposal while e has already submitted five or
more proposals currently in the proposal pool that week; doing so is the
Class N Infraction of Preposterous Propositioning, where N is the number of
times e has committed the infraction this week.

}

[Deterrence for excess proposals, which is currently easily abusable.]
