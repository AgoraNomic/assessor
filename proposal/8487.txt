Title: Simpler ribbon switches
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: R. Lee


Amend Rule 2438 (Ribbons) by replacing this text:

  Ribbon Ownership is a secured person switch, tracked by the
  Tailor in eir monthly report, whose values are the subsets of
  the set of types of Ribbon, defaulting to the empty set. If the
  rules are amended to change the types of Ribbon, if a player's
  Ribbon Ownership is subsequently illegal, then it is updated by
  removing all nonexistent types rather than resetting the entire
  value to default.

  To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to add that type of Ribbon
  to that person's Ribbon Ownership. A person "owns a <Ribbon type>"
  if that type of Ribbon is an element of eir Ribbon Ownership.

with this text:

  For each type of Ribbon, <type> Ribbon Ownership is a secured
  negative boolean person switch, tracked by the Tailor in eir
  monthly report.

  To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to flip that person's
  <that type> Ribbon Ownership to True. A person "owns a <Ribbon
  type>" if eir <that type> Ribbon Ownership is True.

and by replacing this text:

  While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
  Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
  That person's Ribbon Ownership becomes the empty set.

with this text:

  While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
  Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
  When a person wins this way, for each type of Ribbon, that
  person's <type> Ribbon Ownership is flipped to False.

For each type of Ribbon, for each person whose Ribbon Ownership prior to
the adoption of this proposal included that type, flip eir <that type>
Ribbon Ownership to True.
