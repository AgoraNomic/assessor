Enact the following rule ("Agoran Christmas"):
{
Agoran Christmas is an anti-holiday existing every February 29th.
In the month leading to Agoran Christmas, Krampus is an office, responsible
for tracking the naughty list monthly. If the naughty list is ever not
tracked, it is empty.

Whenever a player votes AGAINST a proposal to repeal a rule, they are put
onto the naughty list.
Every week, Krampus CAN announce that e is collecting taxes, specifying all
the players on the naughty list, and all players not on the naughty list.
By doing so, the naughty players have their radiance reduced by 10, and the
radiance of the other players are increased by the amount the naughty
player's lost, divided evenly between them, rounded down.
}
PUT EVERY PLAYER WHO VOTES AGAINST THIS RULE ONTO THE NAUGHTY LIST!
