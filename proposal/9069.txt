Amend Rule 2685 (Crystals) by replacing
{

- If that crystal's owner is not the author of that proposal, the
        instability of that crystal is increased by 3.

}

with


{

- If that crystal's owner is not the author of that proposal, the
        instability of that crystal is increased by 1.

- If that crystal's owner is not the author or coauthor of that proposal,
the
        instability of that crystal is increased by 2.

}

[This makes the rule function the same when there's no coauthors, but if
there's a coauthor that owns the crystal of the modified rule, its
instability is only increased by 1 instead of 3.]
