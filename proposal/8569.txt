Amend Rule 2124 by replacing the following text:

{

  The entities eligible to support or object to an intent to perform
  an action are, by default, all players, subject to modification by
  the document authorizing the dependent action.

}

with the following text:

{

  A document that authorizes a dependent action, by default, implicitly
  asserts that all players are eligible to support or object to an intent
  to perform that action; if the document is a rule, conflicts about
  eligibility (including conflicts with such an implicit assertion) are
  resolved using the normal procedures.

}


Set the power of Rule 2480 (Festivals) to 3.1.

Set the power of Rule 2481 (Festival Restrictions) to 3.1.


Amend Rule 2481 (Festival Restrictions) by replacing "Non-Festive
players are never considered Supporters of a dependent action" with
"Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, non-Festive players are not
eligible to support a dependent action".


[Currently, eligibility to object/support to a dependent action is
defined wholly by the rule defining the action. This breaks the festival
rule that non-festive players are not considered supporters. This
proposal changes the definition of eligibility so that it uses the
normal precedence rules, then raises the power of Festivals so that it
applies to the highest-power dependent action (emergency regulation
changes).]
