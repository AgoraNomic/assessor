Title: AI voting method clarification
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 1950 by replacing "For any Agoran decision with an adoption
index" with "For any Agoran decision with a non-"none" adoption index".

[Legislates the decision in CFJ 3746. All Agoran decisions possess an
adoption index switch, but some of them have the value "none".]
