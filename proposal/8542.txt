Title: Stone Excitement Act
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: Aspen


Amend Rule 2643 "Collecting Stones" by replacing the final paragraph
with the following:
{

  A collection notice includes zero or more random choices of whether each
  stone escapes. Each choice results in escape with probability equal to
  its escape risk; a stone escapes if any choice selects escape. When a
  collection notice is published, stones that escape are transferred to
  Agora in an order specified by the collection notice.

  If a stone is immune, there are zero escape choices; otherwise, there is
  one choice if the stone was used in the previous Agoran month, or two if
  it was not.

}
