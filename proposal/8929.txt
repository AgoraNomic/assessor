Amend Rule 2124 ("Performing Tabled Actions") by deleting the list item
containing "Cease to be a" and by inserting the following after the
first paragraph:

{

A supporter/objector to an intent, acting as emself, CAN by announcement
cease to be a supporter/objector ("withdraw" support/objection) of that
intent.

Limiting the ability to support or object to an intent is secured at the
power of the rule enabling that action to be performed.

}
