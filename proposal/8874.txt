[== This first section is mostly small fixes.==]

Amend Rule 2668 (Horses) by replacing "Dollaries (singular: dollary) are a
fixed currency. Hooves (singular: hoof) are a fixed currency." with
"Dollaries (singular: dollary) are a fixed currency. Hooves (singular:
hoof) are a fixed currency. Any Dollaries or Hooves in abeyance or not
owned by a player are immediately destroyed."

[Clears hooves and dollaries from the L&FD, where they are currently
unauctionable.]

Amend Rule 2672 (Weekly Race Action) by replacing "bet 1, 2, or 3 dollaries
on a specified horse by paying a fee of 1, 2, or 3 dollaries respectively."
with "bet 1, 2, or 3 dollaries on a specified Running horse by paying a fee
of 1, 2, or 3 dollaries respectively."

[It would be silly to bet on horses that have already finished in the race!]

Amend Rule 2673 (Motivating Horses) by replacing {

Each horse has an associated non-repeating set of horses, their "pulls",
tracked by the Horsened.

}

with {

Pulls (syn. pull) is a Horse switch, tracked by the Horsened. It has
possible values of any set of horses.

}

[Make pulls a switch instead of the nonsense from before.]

Amend Rule 2674 (Horse Powers) by replacing {

Fargo's power: (WEEKLY POWER)  * get a helmet for and bet 2
      dollaries on a specified horse, by paying 1 hoof.

}

with {

Fargo's power: (WEEKLY POWER)  * get a helmet for and then bet 2
      dollaries on a specified horse, by paying 1 hoof.

}

and by replacing {

Sugar's power: (WEEKLY POWER)  * get a helmet for and increase the
      Race Position of a specified horse by 1, by paying 1 hoof.

}

with {

Sugar's power: (WEEKLY POWER)  * get a helmet for and then increase the
      Race Position of a specified horse by 1, by paying 1 hoof.
}

[This should make it so you can't use these powers on horses you already
got a helmet for.]


[==These next changes have a larger mechanical impact.==]

Amend Rule 2672 (Weekly Race Action) by replacing

{
* gain 4 dollaries by announcement.
}

with

{
* gain 5 dollaries by paying 3 hooves.

* gain 1 hoof by announcement.
}

[This makes dollaries more scarce, and hooves a more important resource to
manage.]

Amend Rule 2499 (Welcome packages) by replacing

{
  * 1 Stamp of eir own type
}

with

{
  * 1 Stamp of eir own type
  * the number of hooves the player(s) with the most hooves has
}

[New players aren't behind in the hooves this way.]

Amend Rule 2670 (Horse Victory) by replacing

{
      * the player that owns the horse with a Race Place of first gains
        50 dollaries.

      * the player that owns the horse with a Race Place of second gains
        30 dollaries.

      * the player that owns the horse with a Race Place of third gains
        15 dollaries.
}

with

{
      * the player that owns the horse with a Race Place of first gains
        30 dollaries.

      * the player that owns the horse with a Race Place of second gains
        20 dollaries.

      * the player that owns the horse with a Race Place of third gains
        15 dollaries.
}

[This should balance horse ownership a bit more, and is especially needed
if dollary generation is being decreased.]
