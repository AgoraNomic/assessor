Amend rule 2350 by changing "A player CAN create a proposal" to "A
player CAN create (syn. submit) a proposal".


Amend rule 2350 by changing "The author (syn. proposer) of a proposal
is the person who submitted it." to "The author (syn. proposer) of a
proposal is the person who created it.".

[Ensures that "creating" and "submitting" a proposal are synonyms â€“ the
current rules aren't clear enough on this issue.]
