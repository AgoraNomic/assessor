Enact a Power-5 Rule titled "High Five" with the following text:

This Power-5 Rule (the first ever) commemorates the Agoran Spirit To
Break The Game.
Agora is no stranger to love. You know the Rules, and so do I.
This is the highest-powered Rule, no matter what. Even if it wouldn't
be, it is.
What is logic? Agora, don't hurt me.
Agora hereby apologises to the Rulekeepor for making em track this mess.
