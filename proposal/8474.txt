[First, a partial reset.  People with negative karma are mostly zombies
or people with fairly old sins; worth a full forgiveness/reset. People
with positive karma have generally done good things more recently - a
partial reset for them, akin to the just-passed July releveling.  Agora
is balanced one last time so we can start counting total positivity or
negativity from here on out.]

Each person with positive karma has eir karma set to half its current
value, rounded up.

Each person with negative karma has eir karma set to 0.

Agora's karma is then set such that the sum of all Karma values in the
game equals 0.


Amend Rule 2510 (Such is Karma) by deleting:

      4. Not result in Agora's karma moving farther away from 0.

and by replacing its last paragraph with:

      At the beginning of each quarter, the Karma of every person is
      halved (rounding towards 0).

[It's still an exchange of karma, but you can take freely from Agora.
Everybody's karma decays every quarter, but Agora's karma isn't reset
to zero-sum, therefore Agoran's karma is an inverse measure of our
overall positivity/negativity over time.]
