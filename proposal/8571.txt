Title: Gauntlet announcement patch
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet

Amend Rule 2644 (The Gauntlet) to read, in whole:

{

  A player CAN, by announcement, Notice the Gauntlet, specifying a single
  player that owns 5 or more stones. When e does, the specified player
  Wields the Gauntlet.

  When a player Wields the Gauntlet, e wins the game, then all existing
  stones are transferred to Agora.

}

[This removes the possibility of accidentally causing someone to Wield
the Gauntlet by changing the "correct announcement" to a specific
action. For instance, I am concerned that a Stonemason's weekly report
might be considered such an announcement.]
