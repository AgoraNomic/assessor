Create a rule entitled "The Veblen" with power 0.5 reading:

       The Veblen is a unique indestructible fixed asset.

       Ownership of the Veblen is entirely restricted to Agora and
       players. If the Veblen is owned by the Lost and Found Department
       or in abeyance, it is immediately transferred to Agora.

       The Veblen Cost is a secured singleton switch with values of
       positive integers and a default of 1.

       Any player CAN pay a fee of X Spendies to transfer the Veblen to
       to emself, where X is a value greater than or equal to the
       current Veblen Cost. Upon doing so, e gains ownership of the
       Veblen, and the Veblen Cost is set to X+1.

       The Veblen Cost and the ownership of the Veblen are tracked by
       the Absurdor.

       The owner of the Veblen SHOULD conspicuously show off eir
       ownership of it from time to time.
