Title: Deputisation rewrite
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: G., ais523


Amend Rule 2160 ("Deputisation") by replacing the sole list with the
following:
{
  1. the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of holding
  that office, to perform the action (this requirement is fulfilled by the
  deputy performing the action); and, it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy
  to perform the action, other than by deputisation, if e held the office;
  and, the deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is doing
  so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation; and, the deputy has not
  held the office in the past 7 days; and,

  2. any of the following are true:
     (A) the office is vacant;
     (B) a time limit by which the rules require the action to be
         performed has expired, the office's holder has not changed
         in the past 7 days, and any of the following are true:

           (i) the deputy announced between two and fourteen days earlier
               that e intended to deputise for that office for the purposes
               of the particular action;
          (ii) the time limit expired between 14 days ago and 28 days ago;
         (iii) the time limit expired more than 28 days ago and the
               deputisation is temporary;
}

[This simplifies the list significantly, hopefully making it clearer. It
also makes the following substantive changes: allows only temporarily
deputisation (or deputisation with notice) for old duties, prohibits
deputies who have held the office in the past 7 days, and prohibits
deputising for an office whose holder has changed in the past 7 days, to
allow a holder time to catch up when they assume a new office, and to
prevent rapid-fire changes resulting from deputisation fights.]
