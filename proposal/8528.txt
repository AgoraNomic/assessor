Title: Gaining Assets
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aspen
Co-authors: Gaelan


[There are reasonable complaints that the word "earn" is confusing,
because it conveys the idea of becoming entitled to an asset, rather than
the idea of coming into possession of an asset. It also clashes with the
terminology we use for ribbons. This proposal fixes the problems
by changing the word to "gain", to match "loose".]

Amend Rule 2577, "Asset Actions", by replacing:

  For an entity to earn an asset is for that asset to be created in
  that entity's possession.

with:

  For an entity to gain (historical syn. earn) an asset is for that asset to be
  created in that entity's possession.
