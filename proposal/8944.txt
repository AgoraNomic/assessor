Amend Rule 1006 by replacing the final paragraph with the following:

{

Immediately after a proposal finishes taking effect, if one or more
offices exist that did not exist prior to the proposal taking effect,
each such office, if it is vacant, becomes held by the author of the
proposal.

}

Amend Rule 2657 by replacing each instance of "proposal that takes
effect" with "proposal that takes effect, at the instant it finishes
taking effect" and by replacing "Having an Agoran Birthday: X, where X
is the number of active players during eir birthday". with "Having an
Agoran Birthday, at the instant it begins: X, where X is the number of
active players at the instant the condition was fulfilled."
