Add a new paragraph to the end of rule 991:
{{{
      If two CFJs become assigned to the same judge in the same
      message, those CFJs are "linked" to each other, unless that
      message specifies that the CFJs should not be linked. The
      Arbitor SHOULD consider linking two CFJs if they inquire about
      the same or substantially similar events and are called at
      approximately the same time.
}}}

Amend the first paragraph of rule 2553 to read:
{{{
      If a CFJ about the effectiveness, possibility, or legality of a
      change in the gamestate has been assigned a judgement of
      PARADOXICAL continuously for between 7 and 90 days, then that
      case's initiator, CAN, by announcement, Transcend Logic,
      specifying that CFJ, provided that e has not already won the game
      with respect to that CFJ or to a CFJ linked to it. When a person
      transcends logic, e wins the game.
}}}
