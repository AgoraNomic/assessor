If all of the following is true:
- An office called the "Ricemastor" exists
- Undercooked players exist (be the "Rice Time" the time between the moment
that "The Rice Game" rule was added to the ruleset, and the 24 hours
posterior, and all players that had gained Rice during that period be known
as "Undercooked" players).
Then, set the Rice of all Undercooked players to 0.

Otherwise, this Proposal does nothing.
