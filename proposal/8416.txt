Amend Rule 2141 by replacing the text

  Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.

with

  Every rule shall have an ID number, distinct among current and
  former rules, to be assigned once by the Rulekeepor.

[Comment: this version is designed to prevent the Rulekeepor from
assigning the same ID to two rules in addition to the protection
against changing IDs.]
