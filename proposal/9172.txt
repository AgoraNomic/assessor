[Allows the current owner to bid up the cost.]

       A player who does not own the Veblen CAN pay a fee of X spendies
       to purchase the Veblen, where X is an integer not less than the
       current Veblen cost. When e does so, the Veblen is transferred to
       em, then the Veblen cost is set to X+1.

       transferred to em.
