Amend Rule 2531 by changing the list item labeled (2) to read, in its
entirety:  "(2) it attempts to levy a fine for an action or inaction
which, at the time the inaction or action occurred, was not prohibited
by the rules;"

[This ensures that, as long as an action violated the rules when it was
committed, it can be punished. For instance, the Assessor could commit a
crime immediately before resolving a proposal that changes the
definition of the crime. Currently, it's possible the Assessor could not
be punished, since the rules at the time of the fine being levied would
not prohibit the action, even if it was illegal at the time it occurred.]
