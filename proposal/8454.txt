Amend Rule 991 (Calls for Judgement) by replacing:
  When a CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
  eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
  in a timely fashion.
with:
  When an open CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
  eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
  in a timely fashion after it becomes an open and unassigned CFJ.

and by replacing:
  Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
  person or "unassigned" (default).
with:
  Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
  person or former person, or "unassigned" (default).


Every CFJ that had a former person as a judge immediately before Proposal
8134 took effect (02 Dec 2018) hereby has their judge switch flipped to
that judge.

[I'm really, really sure there's been no changes or attempted changes to
former persons' judgeship since Dec 2018, since all those cases were long
before that and I'd remember that].

If G. received any blots in the past two months as the result of failure
to assign a judge in a timely manner to any CFJ whose judge has been
changed by this proposal, that number of blots are expunged from em.

[Don't mind about 1 blot, this is mainly protection against "infinite"
blotting if it happens]
