Amend Rule 2645 by (as a single amendment) replacing "the Soul Stone is
transferred" with "this stone is transferred",  by replacing: "The
Recursion Stone can be wielded" with "This stone can be wielded", and by
replacing "the Anti-Equatorial Stone's mossiness" with "the wielded
stone's mossiness".

[Ensure that these stones don't break when used with the Recursion Stone.]


Amend Rule 2642 by replacing the paragraph beginning "At the beginning
of each week" with the following paragraph:

{

At the beginning of each week, a player has an active reach if e reached
for a stone in the previous week and that stone is currently owned by
Agora, and the stone reached for by the player with an active reach who
has the highest Modified Rockiness is transferred to em. In a tie, the
reached for by the tied player with an active reach who reached first in
the previous week is transferred. When a player receives a stone in this
way, eir Base Rockiness is set to 0.

}

[Ensure that stones aren't transferred between players due to reaching.]
