ID: 8490
Title: Functional Emergency Regulations
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2614 by appending the following sentence to the paragraph
beginning "The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 3
Agoran consent": "To the extent explicitly permitted by this rule,
Emergency Regulations are always taking effect."

[Right now, Emergency Regulations CAN do some stuff, but they never
actually take effect to do it.]
