[ Comment: I'm not sure if it's intentional for "proposals" and "other
   changes to the gamestate" to be separate and have the same clause
   following them, but, assuming there's not, it couldn't hurt to cut
   down a bit on the repeated text. ]

Replace the following paragraph in Rule 1698 "Agora is a Nomic":

  If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
  Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist,
  it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. If
  any other single change or inseparable group of changes to the
  gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
  Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding.

with:

  inseparable group of changes to the gamestate, including
  proposals, would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause

  contrary notwithstanding.
