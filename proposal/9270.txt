Title: The Number Cards Game
Adoption index: 2.0

In rule 991, after
{{{
When an open CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
in a timely fashion after it becomes an open and unassigned CFJ.
}}},
add
{{{
In the same message in which e does so, e SHALL also (and CAN by
announcement or by clear specification) assign it an ID number, unless
it already has one.
}}}

Create a new power-1 rule, "Number Cards":
{{{
Number cards are a type of asset. Ownership of number cards is
restricted to players and contracts. Each number card has a type, which
is a decimal digit in the range 0 to 9 inclusive. Number cards with the
same type are fungible.

The Numerator is an office, and the recordkeepor of number cards.
}}}

Create a new power-1 rule, "Scoring Numbers":
{{{
Whenever an inquiry case with an ID number is assigned a judgement, if
it had never previously been assigned a judgement, its judge scores its
ID number, unless its initiator had initiated 4 or more other CFJs
earlier in the same week that it was initiated.

Whenever a distributed proposal is adopted, its author scores its ID
number, unless its author had submitted 8 or more proposals earlier in
the same week that it was submitted.

Whenever a player scores a number as described in this rule, the
Numerator CAN once, and SHALL in a timely manner, grant its author
(and, if the number was scored due to the adoption of a proposal, also
a randomly chosen other player who voted FOR on a referendum to adopt
that proposal) a number card for each digit in that number, whose type
is that digit.

Officers SHALL NOT assign ID numbers to distributed proposals or CFJs
that are out of sequence, but are given reasonable discretion to
determine what "in sequence" means (e.g. officers may choose whether to
include or exclude in the numbering sequence entities whose proposal or
CFJ status is disputed or unclear). ID numbers that are more than 5
digits long cannot be scored (this is an exception to the other
paragraphs of this rule and takes precedence over them).
}}}

Create a new power-1 rule, "Spending Number Cards":
{{{
A player CAN, once per week, pay ten number cards, where each of those
number cards is of a different type, to gain 25 radiance.

For any two decimal digits X and Y (which may be the same), a player
CAN pay 2 spendies, a number card of type X, and a number card of type
Y to grant emself a number card whose type is the last digit of the sum
X+Y.
}}}

[Trigon said via IRC/Discord: "ais523: if you draft your idea, you have
my express permission to install me to the office by proposal."]

Flip the Officeholder of the Numerator office to Trigon.
