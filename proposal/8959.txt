In rule 2656, amend
{{{
     Upon a correct announcement from a player that eir radiance is 100
     or more (correctly specifying the amount), e wins the game. Then,
     eir radiance is set to 0, and all other players' radiance are set
     to half their current value rounded down.
}}}
to
{{{
     A player whose radiance is 100 or more CAN by announcement Become
     Radiant, as long as e correctly specifies the amount of eir
     Radiance in the same message. When a player Becomes Radiant, e
     wins the game; and when a player wins the game by this mechanism,
     eir Radiance is flipped to 0.
}}}

[Removes the reset on radiance; see my recent these for arguments on
why I think this is beneficial. There are also two bugfixes: one that
handles the situation where a higher-powered rule blocks the win, and
one that prevents radiance wins being accidentally triggered by, e.g.,
the Herald's report when the Herald has 100 radiance.]
