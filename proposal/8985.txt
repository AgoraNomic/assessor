/*Comment: I'm fine with rewarding officers and such with more voting
power, but it seems obscene to me when certain players can have almost four
(4!!!) times the voting power of a newbie. It's too greedy, too
controlling, too much.

Let's give everyone a more equal chance to be relevant.

This is a low AI version. Amending the rule that gives players the default
3 Voting Strength would require a AI-3 Proposal, which seems difficult to
pass or at least, it would be very easy to block.*/

If the Proposal named "Democratization (high AI version)" is ADOPTED, then
this Proposal does nothing. Otherwise:

Create a new power-1 rule titled "Democratization" that says:

{Each player has their voting strength increased by 5.}
