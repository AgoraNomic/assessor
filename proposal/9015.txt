If a rule named "Laserwort" exists, then enact a rule with the title
"Antitrust Laws", Power 1 and the text:

{{

   Any player CAN, once per week, pay laserwort equal to one-half the
stock to win the game. When a player wins by this method, the following
occur:
   - For each player with fewer than 5 laserwort, that player gains
laserwort equal to the difference.
   - For each player with more than 5 laserwort, that player loses
laserwort equal to one-half the difference (rounded down).

}}
