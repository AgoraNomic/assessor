[This explicitly allow contracts to define switches. They maybe work
okay anyway, but this puts things on a firmer foundation. The "secured"
definition is deliberately left referencing Rules only, as a contract
doesn't have power.

I considered amending the third paragraph of rule 2698 (Recordkeepors),
but contracts have plenty of flexibility to impose any desired reporting
requirements for their switches (or to leave them untracked).]

Amend rule 2162 (Switches) by making the following replacements, in order:

1) Replace:

       A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a switch,
       and specify the following:

    with:

       A type of switch is a property that a rule or a contract defines
       as a switch (with such rule or contract being its backing
       document) and specifies the following:

2) Replace:

       If a type of switch is not explicitly designated as
       possibly-indeterminate by the rule that defines it, and if an
       action or set of actions would cause the value of an instance of
       that type of switch to become indeterminate, that instance instead
       takes on its last determinate and possible value, if any,
       otherwise it takes on its default value.

    with:

       If a type of switch is not explicitly designated as
       possibly-indeterminate by its backing document, and if an action
       or set of actions would cause the value of an instance of that
       type of switch to become indeterminate, that instance instead
       takes on its last determinate and possible value, if any,
       otherwise it takes on its default value.
