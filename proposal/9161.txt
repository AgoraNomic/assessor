For each office, if any information is defined by the rules as part of
that office's weekly or monthly report, then its officeholder SHALL
maintain all such information, and eir weekly or monthly duties
respectively include publishing a document or series of documents,
labelled as that office's report (or as that office's weekly or monthly
report as appropriate), that includes all such information.
}}}

[The intent behind this proposal is to make it possible to
unambiguously identify whether an office has missed a report, by
requiring the report to be labelled as one, and thus makes it possible
to deputise based on a missed report.]
