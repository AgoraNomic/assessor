Amend Rule 2683 (The Boulder) by replacing the paragraph beginning "Each
player CAN," with this text:

       The Boulder's Slope is a singleton integer switch defaulting to 1,
       tracked by the Absurdor.

       Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
       When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
       At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was pushed in the
       previous week at least as many times as the Boulder's Slope, then
       the Boulder's Slope is increased by 1; otherwise, the Boulder's
       Height is set to 0, and the Boulder's Slope is set to 1. The
       Absurdor SHOULD list the largest Height and Slope of the Boulder
       ever reached in eir report.
