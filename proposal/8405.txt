Title: Generic private assets
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2166 by replacing the text "one defined by a contract is
private" with the text "any other asset is private".

[This removes an underpowered dependency of Rule 2166 and makes sure
that if we (for some reason) expand Mint Authority we don't forget to
change this.]
