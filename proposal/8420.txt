Amend Rule 2451 (Executive Orders) by appending the following paragraph:

  If this rule is changed in any way, then in the 7 days
  following the change, any player CAN issue a Citizens'
  Recall by announcement.  Doing so causes the office of
  Prime Minister to become vacant, and then initiates an
  election for the office if one is not already ongoing.
