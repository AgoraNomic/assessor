Title: Radiance v1.1

[This proposal reskins points/score as "radiance" and also changes the
scoring conditions to be cashed by players. IE, insteead of the assessor
granting points for proposals, each player must claim them. Also
introduce gains/grants language to get rid of clunkier things, and adds
some requirements to specify your radiance when winning, and where you
gained the radiance from when you do.]

Retitle R2656 to "Radiance".

Amend R2656 to read in full:

       A player's Radiance is an integer player switch defaulting to 0,
       tracked by the Herald. When a player is "granted" or "gains" a
       specified amount of radiance, eir radiance is increased by that
       amount.

       Upon a correct announcement from a player that eir radiance is 100
       or more (correctly specifying the amount), e wins the game. Then,
       eir radiance is set to 0, and all other players' radiance are set
       to half their current value rounded down.

       At the start of every quarter, all radiance switches are set to
       half their current value rounded down.

For each player, set eir radiance switch to be equal to the value eir
score switch was at immediately before this proposal was adopted.

Retitle R2657 to "Gaining Radiance".

Amend R2657 to read, in full:

       Each time a player fulfills a radiance condition, e CAN once by
       announcement (specifying any indicated info) gain the associated
       radiance.

       Below is a list of radiance conditions:

         * Being the author of a proposal that takes effect: 5 (must
           specify proposal number)

         * Being a coauthor of a proposal that takes effect: 1 (must
           specify proposal number)

         * Having an Agoran Birthday: X, where X is the number of active
           players during eir birthday.

         * Judging a CFJ that e was assigned to without violating a time
           limit to do so, unless at the time of judgement the case was
           open due to self-filing a motion to reconsider it: 2 (must
           specify CFJ number)

Amend R2659 by replacing "increase eir own score by (X^2)-X points" with
"gain (X^2)-X radiance" and replacing "increase eir own score by (X-1)*2
points" with "gain (X-1)*2 radiance".

In R2670 replacing:

         The score of the player that has the most dollaries is increased
         by 30.  In the event of an N-way tie, instead, each tied
         player's score is increased by 30/N points, rounded down.

with:

         The player that has the most dollaries gains 30 radiance. In the
         event of an N-way tie, instead, each tied player gains 30/N
         radiance, rounded down.

In R2675 replace every instance of "score" with "radiance".

Amend R2645 by replacing:

       - Score Stone (Weekly, 3): When wielded, a specified player's
         (defaulting to the wielder if not specified) Score is increased
         by 3.

with:

       - Radiance Stone (Weekly, 3): When wielded, a specified player
         (defaulting to the wielder if not specified) gains 3 radiance.

and replacing:

         When this stone is wielded, the wielder specifies an eligible
         player and gains 8 points.

with:

         When this stone is wielded, the wielder specifies an eligible
         player and gains 8 radiance.
