[Note that Gaelan's win should have been processed by the time
this is adopted, unless there's an appeal.]

Amend Rule 591, "Delivering Judgements", by removing the text:

  * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
    undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresovable
    logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
    is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
    arises from the case itself or in reference to it.

and:

  DISMISS is not appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.

Repeal Rule 2553, "Win by Paradox".
