Title: Welcome Package Tweak

Amend rule 2499 (Welcome Packages) by replacing:

       * One stamp of eir own type.
       * 10 spendies, if e has not been granted any spendies since e last
         registered.

with:

       * 15 spendies, if e has not been granted any spendies since e last
         registered.

[A frequent pattern is: a new person joins, gets a welcome package, does
essentially nothing further, then is deregistered. This results in a
proliferation of stamp types. The revised package allows a new player
the ability to purchase multiple stamps of eir own type, if e wants to
and does so.

Also, the welcome package as it stands now grants even players with too
many stamps to use the normal rule 2659 mechanism (6 spendies for X
stamps) yet another stamp of eir type.]
