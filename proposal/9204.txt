Amend Rule 2701 ("Stamp Scamp") to read, in whole:

{

A rare stamp is a stamp that is the only one of its type that exists.

Stamp scamp is a singleton switch tracked by the Collector with possible
values of each player and null (default). Upon a correct announcement
that a specified player owns more rare stamps than any other player, the
stamp scamp switch is flipped to that player.

If no person has done so by this mechanism in this quarter, the value of
the stamp scamp switch, if a player, CAN by announcement cause another
specified player to gain one stamp of that player's type.

}

If exactly one player holds the patent title of Stamp Scamp, the stamp
scamp switch is hereby flipped to that player.

The patent title "Stamp Scamp" is hereby revoked from each player that
holds it.

[Switches are the standard way to track state like this. We shouldn't
use a patent title for this. The current Herald is not actually
reporting, so it will not actually be tracked; the Herald's report
should be used for historical matters, not (new) ephemera; and it will
hand out violet ribbons for very little reason.]
