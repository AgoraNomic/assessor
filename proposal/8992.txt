Enact a Power 0.5 rule with title “The Boulder” and text

{
The Absurdor is an office.

The Boulder's Height is a singleton integer switch defaulting to 0,
tracked by the Absurdor.

Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder. When
a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1. Players are
ENCOURAGED to do so. The Boulder MUST be pushed at least once a week.

If at any point the height of the Boulder is 100 or more, it is set to 0.
}

Set the complexity of the Absurdor's office to 0.
