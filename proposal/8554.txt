[This is intended to remove the need to put in a special provision
to a promise allow the creator to destroy a promise in the possession of
the Library. Since that's usually what's wanted, this makes it the
default behavior, while still allowing the creator to override it.]

Amend Rule 2618, "Promises", by inserting, after the text:

  The Library is an entity and CAN own promises. Any player CAN take
  a specified promise from the Library by announcement, provided e
  cashes the promise in the same message.

the text:

  The creator of a promise CAN take or revoke it from the Library by
  announcement, unless the promise's text unambiguously designates
  it as irrevocable.
