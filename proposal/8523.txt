[Currently, the concentration stone plus the economy focus would
 create over 1000 coins. That represents inflation of more than 10%.
 Obviously, that wasn't what we had in mind. The plan is to delay
 termination of the auction until this is resolved, so people should
 be able to adjust their bids.]

Amend the rule entitled "The Stones" by replacing:
  - Concentration Stone (weekly, 60%)
with:
  - Concentration Stone (monthly, 60%)
