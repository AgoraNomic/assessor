Amend Rule 2531 by replacing the first paragraph with the following:
{
  Any attempt to levy a fine is INEFFECTIVE if it does not include value
  of the fine in blots, the name of the person being fined (the perp), and
  the specific reason for the fine.
}

Amend Rule 2531 by renumbering the list so that the numbers start at 1
and end at 10, with each number other than the fist one higher than the
previous.
