[ COMMENT: After the reset, the poor player who still has the highest
   claim might be forced to pay for nothing; or, more realistically, the
   auction runner might just not be able to distribute lots for the
   auction. Either way, this is certainly not an ideal situation. ]

In Rule 2561 "VP Wins" replace the following:

  Four days after such a win occurs, all Cards and all Products are
  destroyed.

with:

  Four days after such a win occurs, all Cards and all Products are
  destroyed and any ongoing victory auctions end with no victors.

All victory auctions that were initiated before this proposal was
created end with no victors.
