[Little buff to CFJs and nerf to Proposals, now that proposals have
become very common. Wording should work with current version or
Radiance.]

Amend R2657 by replacing:

     "Being the author of a proposal that takes effect: 5"

with:

     "Being the author of a proposal that takes effect: 4"

and replacing:

     "Judging a CFJ that e was assigned to without violating a time
limit to do so, unless at the time of judgement the case was open due to
self-filing a motion to reconsider it: 2"

with:

     "Judging a CFJ that e was assigned to without violating a time
limit to do so, unless at the time of judgement the case was open due to
self-filing a motion to reconsider it: 3"
