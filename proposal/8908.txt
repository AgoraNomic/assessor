Title: The Crystal
Adoption index: 1.0

I have yearned for the days of Clork, putting things into knip,
and all of the nonsense that once existed as part of Nomic,
or general self-referential, rule-changing games.
ALAS, this nonsense caused instability in the very foundations of Agora,
AND it was grand.

AND SO, I seek to shaketh the foundations upon which we lie,
upending the system of power and thusly encourage legislative play.

THUSLY, enact a rule entitled "The Crystal" with power=1.0 and the text:
{
The Geologist is the office that tracks crystals.
Each crystal is a liquid asset.
Each crystal has two secured natural integer switches,
one of which is the size, and the other is its identity.
The default size of a crystal is 1.
Each Quarter, the size is reduced by 1 of all crystals with
identifiers that match any rule number in the current ruleset.

Whenever a proposal amends or repeals a rule:
- If a crystal with an identity equal to the number of that rule exists,
  transfer it to the author of the proposal, and increase its size by 1.
- Otherwise, grant the author of the proposal a crystal with the identity
  equal to the number of that rule.

A player CAN, by announcement, Shatter the System, specifying one or more
crystallized entities, provided that no entity has won the game by doing so
in the past 30 days. An entity is crystallized if it owns crystals with a
total
size greater than or equal to the number of rules in the current ruleset.

When the System is Shattered, the specified entities win the game. If an
entity
won the game in this manner 4 or more days ago, any player CAN repeal this
rule
by announcement.
}
