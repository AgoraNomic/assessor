[This avoids the weirdness where having two candidates means new candidates
can join, but if there are fewer the winner is locked in at the end
of the nomination period. This way, new contenders can still join as
long as there's still room for them to change the outcome.]

Amend Rule 2154, "Election Procedure", by changing the text:

  "An election is contested if it has two or more candidates at the
   end of the nomination period, and uncontested otherwise. For a
   contested election, nominations close at the end of the poll's
   voting period. For an uncontested election, nominations close at
   the end of the nomination period."

to read:

  "An election whose nomination period is complete is contested if it has two
   or more candidates, and uncontested otherwise. Nominations close
   at the end of the poll's voting period or when the election is ended,
   whichever comes first."
