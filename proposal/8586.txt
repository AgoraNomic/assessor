Amend Rule 2160 (Deputisation) to read:

  A player acting as emself (the deputy) CAN perform an action
  ordinarily reserved for an office-holder, as if e held the office,
  if:

  1. The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
    holding that office, to perform the action. (This requirement
    is fulfilled by the deputy performing the action.)

  2. It would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
    other than by deputisation, if e held the office.

  3. Either (i) the office is vacant; or (ii) a time limit by
    which the rules require the action to be performed has expired,
    and the deputy announced between two and fourteen days before
    the action that e intended to deputise for the office to
    perform that particular action; or (iii) such a time limit
    expired more than fourteen days ago.

  4. When performing the action, the deputy announces that e is
    doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation.

  When a player deputises for an elected office, e becomes the
  holder of that office, unless the action being performed would
  already install someone into that office, and/or e announces
  that e is doing so by temporary deputisation.
