Amend Rule 2143 by replacing the final paragraph with the following
paragraph:

{

  A player CAN, by announcement, petition a specified non-vacant office to
  take a specific action. The holder of that office SHALL publicly respond
  to that petition in a timely fashion.

}


[Amend away all possible ambiguity about whether petitioning vacant
offices works, and ensure that the duty moves with the office, rather
than attaching to a specific person.]
