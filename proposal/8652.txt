Create a rule with title "Geometry" and text:
{
  The Geometor is an office. The Geometor is the recordkeepor for polygons
  and polyhedra.

  Polygons are a class of asset. Polygons have a corresponding positive
  integer type. For each integer N >= 3, polygons of type N are a currency.
  A player CAN grant emself a polygon of type N by specifying a valid type
  (N) and paying a fee of N^2 boatloads of coins, where N >= 3 and N is an
  integer.

  At the beginning of each month, each player is granted a polygon of type 3.

  A player CAN once per week conglomerate polygons by announcement,
  specifying 2 polygons e owns. When a player conglomerates polygons, a
  new polygon is created in eir possession with type equal to (the sum
  of the two specified polygons' types) minus one, and then the two
  specified polygons are destroyed.

  The Geometer CAN and SHALL once, by announcement and in a timely fashion
  from the end of the month, increase the score of the player(s) who owned
  a polygon with the largest type among all existing polygons at the end of
  the month by a number of points equal to that type.

  A player can, with support, propagate a specified polygon they do not own
  by paying a fee of 1 polygon they own. A propagated polygon is destroyed,
  causing Agora to be granted a polyhedron with the destroyed polygon's type.

  Polyhedra are an indestructible asset with a positive integer type that
  can only be owned by Agora. All polyhedra not owned by agora are
  immediately transferred to Agora.
