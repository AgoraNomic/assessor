[Remove the Hot Potato stone's prohibition on collection (collection is
not transfer by a player).]

Amend Rule 2645 ("The Stones") by replacing "If this stone is not owned
by Agora, it cannot otherwise be transferred, other rules
notwithstanding." with "If this stone is not owned by Agora, a player
CANNOT otherwise transfer it, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.".


[Ensure that no accidental prohibition on collection can happen again.]

Amend Rule 2643 ("Collecting Stones") by replacing "is transferred to
Agora" with "is transferred to Agora, rules to the contrary
notwithstanding".
