Amend Rule 107 (Initiating Agoran Decisions) by replacing this text:

  The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
  for the decision. The voting period lasts for 7 days. The minimum
  voting period for a decision with at least two options is five
  days. The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to
  a duration longer than fourteen days. Changing the length of a
  decision's voting period is secured at power 2.

with this text:

  The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
  for the decision. The default length of the voting period is 7
  days. Changing the length of a decision's voting period is secured
  at power 2, and it CANNOT be set or changed to more than 14 days,
  or less than 5 days for a decision with at least two options.
