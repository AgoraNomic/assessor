[Loosely based on the old Ergs system, basically a currency that was
reset weekly. Repeals or otherwise cleans up some loose ends overlooked
by R2658. Change from proto: Keeps proposal distribution limited.]

Create a rule titled "Proposal Sponsorship" with this text:

      Sponsorship is an untracked proposal switch with values
      unsponsored (default), sponsored, and disinterested.

      The Promotor CAN, with 2+X support, flip a proposal in the
      Proposal Pool from unsponsored to disinterested. For this, X is
      equal to the number of times e has done so in the past 7 days.

      Any player CAN, without objection, flip a proposal in the Proposal
      Pool from unsponsored to disinterested.

Create a rule titled "Weekly Privileges" with Power 2 and this text:

      Each player CAN do one of the following by announcement, provided
      that e has not already done any of them during the same week.

        * Cause a specified person (or emself if no one is specified) to
          Stuff the Ballot Box. A player's Voting Strength on a
          referendum on an ordinary proposal is 1 greater for each time
          e Stuffed the Ballot Box during that decision's voting period.

        * Expunge a blot from a specified person (or emself if no one is
          specified).

        * Cause a specified proposal to become sponsored.

        * Gain an Iridium Star. Iridium Stars are a fixed currency with
          ownership restricted to players. If a player has at least 10
          more Iridium Stars than each other player, and no person has
          won the game this way in the past 30 days, then e CAN Buy the
          Town by announcement. When a player Buys the Town, e wins the
          game, then all Iridium Stars are destroyed.

The winds die down, as defined by Rule 2658 (The Winds Die Down).

[
R2658 then repeals, in this order:
* 2620 (Cards and Sets)
* 2623 (Popular Proposal Proposer Privilege)
* 2629 (Victory Auctions)
* 2624 (Card Administration)
* 2622 (Pending Proposals)
* 2651 (Proposal Recycling)
* 2653 (Buying Strength)
* All clauses delimited ~>like this<~, in rule number order
* itself
]

Repeal these rules, in this order:
* 2621 (VP Wins)
* 2636 (The Ministor)
* 2638 (Player Focuses)

Amend Rule 1607 (Distribution) by replacing this text:

      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time.

with this text:

      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time, but SHALL NOT do so if it is unsponsored.

[replacing the ~> <~ clause removed by R2658]

Amend Rule 2645 (The Stones) by removing the definition of the
Concentration Stone.

Amend Rule 2654 (The Device) by removing each bullet point containing
"Ministry Focus".

Amend Rule 2665 (The Birds) by replacing the definitions of the Owl,
Pigeon, Penguin, and Jay with the following:

      - Owl: A specified person (or emself if no one is specified)
        Stuffs the Ballot Box, as defined by other rules.

      - Pigeon: A specified person (or emself if no one is specified)
        has one blot expunged.

      - Penguin: The playmate gains an Iridium Star.

      - Jay: A specified proposal becomes sponsored.
