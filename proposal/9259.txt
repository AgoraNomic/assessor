Amend Rule 2707 ("Pyrite") by replacing "A player CAN pay a fee of 200
Pyrite to gain 1 Spendie." with "A player CAN pay a fee of 200 Pyrite to
gain 1 Spendie, provided that e has gained fewer than 40 Spendies in
this way during this Agoran month."

[Put a hard cap at 3x normal on spendies per month to prevent
Agoriculture from completely dominating the game.]
