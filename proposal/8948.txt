Amend Rule 2645 (The Stones) by appending the following paragraph:

- Undo Stone (Fortnightly, 3): When wielded while specifying an act of
stone wielding that occurred in the last 24 hours, the effects of the
specified wielding are undone, to the extent POSSIBLE. This is not
retroactive; rather wielding the undo stone causes a reverse effect
(e.g. if the specified previous wielding increased a value, that value
is decreased by the same amount). If wielding the undo stone would
lead to a paradox, it fails instead.
