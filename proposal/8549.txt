[This fixes G.'s scam, which would otherwise allow indeterminacy to be
created through infinite promise loops.]

Amend Rule 2618, "Promises", by inserting, after the text:

  A promise's bearer CAN, by announcement, cash the promise,
  provided that any conditions for cashing it specified by its text
  are unambiguously met. By doing so, e acts on the creator of the
  promise's behalf, causing the creator to act as if e published the
  promise's text, and destroys the promise.

the text:

  However, to limit recursion, no promise can be cashed during the execution
  of another promise unless it existed before the execution of that promise
  began.
