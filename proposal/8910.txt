Amend R2675 ("Dream of Wandering") by replacing:

       - Charity: The Charity Item is the item type that the L&FD owns
         the most of (if there is a tie, the first the L&FD owned, and if
         still tied, the first alphabetically). Immediately after a
         wandering, for each Charity Dreamer, in reverse order of when
         eir Dream was last flipped (and in reverse order of registration
         if tied), one item of the Charity type is transferred from the
         L&FD to em.

with:

       - Charity: A Charity Stamp is a stamp of the type that the L&FD
         owns the most of (if there is a tie, the first the L&FD owned,
         and if still tied, the first alphabetically). Immediately after
         a wandering, for each Charity Dreamer, in reverse order of when
         eir Dream was last flipped (and in reverse order of registration
         if tied), one Charity Stamp is transferred from the L&FD to em.
         If the number of Stamps the L&FD owned during the last
         wandering is greater than 10, this process happens a second
         time. If it is more than 20, this process happens a third time.


[Simpler than the last proposal because it doesn't require knowing the
number of active players, and it also clarifies the number to be looked at
is the stamps owned during the wandering, not after the first set of
transfers.]
