Amend Rule 2465 (Victory by Apathy) by appending this text:

       Announcing intent to Declare Apathy is the Class 5 Infraction of
       Goldbricking, but this infraction is automatically forgiven if its
       sponsor successfully Declares Apathy on the basis of that intent,
       and SHOULD be forgiven if its sponsor demonstrates that e
       reasonably expected to be able to do so (e.g. by exploiting a bug
       in the rules governing tabled actions, or privately bribing
       players not specified to win, but not simply by announcing intent
       and hoping that no other players checked e-mail for a few days).
