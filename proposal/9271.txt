Amend Rule 1688 ("Power") by appending the following paragraph:

{

A Rule that designates the creation of an entity of a given type as
secured (to a given extent) thereby designates the causing of an entity
to have that type as secured (to the same extent). Similarly, a Rule
that designates the destruction of an entity of a given type as secured
(to a given extent) thereby designates the causing of an entity to cease
to have that type as secured (to the same extent).

}


Amend Rule 1607 ("Distribution") by replacing the paragraph beginning
"The destruction of a referendum" with the following paragraph:

{

The destruction of a referendum is secured.

}


Amend Rule 2350 ("Proposals") by replacing "The destruction of a
proposal and the causing of a proposal to cease being a proposal are
secured." with "The destruction of a proposal is secured.".


[More generically handle security around changing the types of entity.
Anything securing the creation of a certain type of entity presumably
also wants to regulate something else becoming that type, and similarly
anything securing the destruction of a certain type of entity presumably
also wants to regulate an entity ceasing to be that type.]
