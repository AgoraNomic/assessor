/* Now that people can expunge each others' blots when they feel
 * an appropriate sentence has been served, blots don't tend to
 * stick around for more than a month or two, so there's not much
 * value in the quarterly blot decay.
 */

Amend Rule 2555, "Blots", by deleting the following paragraph:

  At the beginning of each quarter, half (rounded down) of each
  fugitive's blots are destroyed.
