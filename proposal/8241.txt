Title: Secured switches (v2.0)
Adoption index: 3.0

[Comment: define what it means for switches to be "secured", then use
that definition. This works with default power thresholds since it isn't
R2162 that designates the changes as secured, the Rule that defines the
switch is defined as designating the changes as secured.]

Amend Rule 2162 by appending the following sentence to the paragraph
beginning "At any given time":

  A Rule that designates a switch as "secured" (at a given power
  level) designates changes to the properties of that type of switch
  as secured (at that power level) and designates changes to the value
  of each instance of the switch as secured (at that power level).

Amend Rule 1950 as follows:

  Delete the text "Adoption index is secured with a power threshold of
  2.".

  Replace the text

    Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
    decisions and proposals.

  with the text

    Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
    decisions and proposals, secured at power 2.

Amend Rule 2480 as follows:

  Delete the text "Changes to Festivity are secured.".

  Replace the text "Festivity is a singleton switch" with the text
  "Festivity is a secured singleton switch".

Amend Rule 869 as follows:

  Delete the text "Changes to citizenship are secured.".

  Replace the text "Citizenship is a person switch" with the text
  "Citizenship is a secured person switch".

Amend Rule 478 as follows:

  Delete the text "Changes to publicity are secured.".

  Replace the text "Publicity is a forum switch" with the text
  "Publicity is a secured forum switch.".
