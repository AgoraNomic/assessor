If the proposal "Broad Recursion" (submitted in the same message as this
one) has been adopted or has sufficient voter support to be adopted,
then this proposal has no effect. Otherwise, amend Rule 2645 (The
Stones) by replacing the definition of the Recursion Stone with:

       - Recursion Stone (Monthly, 4): The Recursion Stone can be wielded
         once per month as if it had the power of any other stone of your
         choice (the Blueprint Stone), with any references to the
         Blueprint Stone itself left unchanged unless they specify
         otherwise.
