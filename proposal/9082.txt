Amend rule 2478 (“Justice”) by replacing: {
  A player CAN, by announcement, "note" an unforgiven infraction
  committed by any other player in the last 14 days, specifying the
  incident and the rule it violates (or name of the Infraction if
  it has one).
} with {
  A player CAN, by announcement, "note" an unforgiven infraction
  committed by any other player in the last 14 days, specifying the
  incident and the rule it violates (or name of the Infraction if
  it has one); but a player CANNOT note an infraction that has
  already been investigated.
}

[Currently, if an infraction is noted after it is investigated,
the Investigator SHALL but CANNOT investigate it. This would be
automatically forgiven by 2531, so it’s not an issue in practice,
but let’s fix it properly.]
