Title: Axiom of Limitations
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Jason

Amend Rule 2553 by, as a single amendment, replacing "CAN, by
announcement, Transcend Logic," with "CAN, by announcement, Transcend
Logic, specifying that CFJ," and replacing "for at least 7 days" with
"for between 7 and 90 days".

[Requires that people Transcending Logic specify which case they are
claiming the win for, ensuring that the "with respect to that CFJ"
clause actually functions. Also adds a time limit to claim to prevent
shenanigans and limit the scope of any bugs.]
