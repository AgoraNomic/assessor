If at least one of the following conditions would be met prior to the
amendment, amend Rule 2691 ("Sortition Procedure") by, as a single
amendment:

* If the Rule contains a paragraph beginning "At the beginning of each
quarter", replacing that paragraph with the following paragraphs:

{

A player CAN by announcement initiate a sortition for a vacant
sortitioned office for which a sortition is not ongoing. At the
beginning of each quarter, for each sortitioned office for which a
sortition is not ongoing, the ADoP CAN once by announcement, and SHALL
in a timely fashion, initiate a sortition.

Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a sortition CANNOT be initiated
for an office for which a sortition is ongoing.

}

* If the Rule does not contain a single paragraph beginning "If a
sortition is ever ongoing", appending the following paragraph:

{

If a sortition is ever ongoing for a non-sortitioned office (or for an
office that no longer exists), that sortition immediately ends.

}
