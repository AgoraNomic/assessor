[This is OP and was only used twice in the whole of last year. We could
reform it so that the Referee could only use it for just reasons,
but honestly I don't think that's a priority â€” this feels like
a waste of space on something that's dangerous and almost unused. If
someone wants to add something like it back later, they can figure out how
to do it in less space.]

Repeal Rule 2479, "Official Injustice".

Amend Rule 2478, "Vigilante Justice", by replacing:

  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
  Pointing. If the Referee is the perp, then the Arbitor CAN
  become the investigator of that Finger Pointing by announcement.

  The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger. The Arbitor CANNOT Point eir
  Finger at the Referee. A high crime is any crime specified as
  being class 4 or greater. The Referee CANNOT levy the Cold Hand of
  Justice to punish a high crime, notwithstanding Rule 2478.

with:

  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
  Pointing. When the Referee's Finger is Pointed or the Referee
  is the perp, the Arbitor is the investigator.

  The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger at the Arbitor, and the Arbitor
  CANNOT point eir finger at the Referee.

  A high crime is any crime specified as being class 4 or greater.
  The Referee CANNOT levy the Cold Hand of Justice to punish a high crime,
  the other provisions of this rule notwithstanding.
