Title: Meaningful extra votes
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Murphy

Amend Rule 2423 (First Among Equals) by replacing "voting strength is
increased by 1" to "voting strength is doubled".

[I think this is a no-op due to Interesting Chambers, though.]

Amend Rule 103 (The Speaker) by replacing "voting strength one greater
than e would have" with "voting strength twice what e would have".
