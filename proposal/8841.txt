Title: Spivak Standardization Act v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Aris, Gaelan


Enact a new power-3 rule entitled "Pronoun Prioritization" with the
following text:

{

The Spivak pronouns (e/em/eir) are hereby recognized as the standard
third-person singular personal pronouns in Agora. In official contexts,
players SHOULD use them when referring to non-specific persons or, in
the absence of a clear statement of another preference, when referring
to a specific other person. The use of other singular third-person
pronouns when referring to persons is DISCOURAGED in official contexts,
except upon specific request by that person.

A player CAN, with Agoran consent, cause this rule to amend a specified
other rule of power less than 4, specifying the new text of the rule,
such that the new text rewords and rephrases the existing text in order
to use Spivak pronouns in place of singular they, provided that such
amendment would not result in the meaning or interpretation of that rule
changing in any way.

}
