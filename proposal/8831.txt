Amend R2483 to read in full:

       Coins are the official currency of Agora and are tracked by the
       Treasuror. They can be owned by players, and the Lost and Found
       Department.

Amend R2576 to read in full:

       Each asset has exactly one owner.

       If ownership of an asset is restricted to a class of entities,
       then that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity
       outside that class. By default, ownership of an asset is
       restricted to Agora and players, but an asset's backing document
       may modify this.

       An asset "in abeyance" is one whose owner is nonexistent,
       indeterminate, or invalid. If an asset would otherwise be in
       abeyance, then it is owned by the Lost and Found Department (if
       possible) or destroyed (otherwise), subject to modification by its
       backing document (provided that the modification either destroys
       it or prevents it from being in abeyance). Rules to the contrary
       notwithstanding, the Lost and Found Department can own assets of
       every type. Assets owned by the Lost and Found Department can be
       transferred or destroyed by any player without objection.

Repeal R2631
