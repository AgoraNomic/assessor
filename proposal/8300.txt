If no proposal whose title contains the text "Administrative Adjudication"
has passed within the last 30 days, the remainder of this proposal has no
effect.

Create the following power 3.0 rule entitled "Patches":

  An officer CAN, without 3 objections, pursuant to a memorandum finding it
  in the best interests of the game, issue a regulation known as a patch.
  To the extent the patch is not manifestly abusive, disproportionate, or
  unreasonable, the rules are to be interpreted as if they were modified
  in the manner stipulated by the patch.

  Enacting and modifying patches are secured. A patch's promulgator CAN amend
  it without 3 objections. Any person CAN repeal the patch by announcement
  once it has been rendered obsolete.
