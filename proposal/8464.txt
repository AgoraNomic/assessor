Amend rule 2626 "Certifiable Patches" to read, in full "Any player
CAN, by announcement, certify a specified proposal, causing it to become
pending. A player SHALL NOT do so. Doing so is the Class-25 crime of
Legislative Misconduct. The amount of Blots given for this crime SHOULD be
significantly reduced in and only in cases of utter and manifest necessity"

Retitle rule 2626 to "Costly Certification"
