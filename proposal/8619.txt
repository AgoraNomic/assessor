Enact a new power-1 rule entitled "The Bottomless Pit":

  Any player CAN throw (syn. "yeet") a number of coins into the
  Bottomless Pit by announcement. Upon doing so, the specified number
  of coins is destroyed from eir posession.

  Though these coins may be gone for all legal purposes within this
  sacred game of Nomic, let the wise Agoran note that these coins are
  not truly gone, but have simply taken on a new form in the Infinity
  of the Pit...
