Author: G.

Amend Rule 2553 (Win by Paradox) by replacing:

  that case's initiator CAN, by announcement, win the game.

with:

  that case's initiator, CAN, by announcement, Transcend Logic.  When
  a person transcends logic, e wins the game.


[This should make all wins in the rules indirect:  Ribbons,
Tournaments, and Apathy are indirect already]
