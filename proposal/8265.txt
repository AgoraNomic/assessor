Enact a new Rule of Power 3.0 with the text:

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding:

    * the Rulekeepor's reports NEED NOT include this rule or any
      information about it;

    * the Rulekeepor NEED NOT assign this rule a title;

    * players SHALL NOT clearly identify this rule - doing so is the
      Class 1 Crime of Uttering the Forbidden Name.

   Any player CAN, without objection, exorcise this rule (cause it to
   repeal itself).

/* Changes from Murphy's version: added "any information about it" (like
 * annotations, etc) to the list of things the Rulekeepor doesn't have to
 * publish; added an extra safety so that we can get rid of it quickly if
 * necessary.
 */

/* Changes from my first version: increased to Power 3 to overrule reporting
 * requirements; removed the Rulekeepor's requirement to assign a title without
 * identifying it; added an explicit SHALL NOT to Uttering the Forbidden Name;
 * moved the SHALL NOT to within the RttCN clause to overrule the requirement
 * for freedom of speech.
 */
