Amend Rule 1728 to read, in whole:

  The following methods of taking actions are known as "dependent
  actions":

  1. without N objections, where N is a positive integer no greater
  than 8 ("without objection" is shorthand for this method with N = 1);

  2. with N support, where N is a positive integer ("with support" is
  shorthand for this method with N = 1);

  3. with N Agoran consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1 with
  a minimum of 1 ("With Agoran consent" is shorthand for this method
  with N = 1);

  4. with notice; or

  5. with T notice, where T is a time period.

  N is 1 unless otherwise specified.


Amend Rule 2595 as follows:

  In the first sub-bullet under item 2 of the only list, replace the
  text "with T Notice" with the text "with T notice".

  In the second sub-bullet under item 2 of the only list, replace the
  text "Without N Objections, With N Support, or With N Agoran
  Consent" with the text "without N objections, with N support, or
  with N Agoran Consent".

  In the first sub-bullet under item 3 of the only list, replace the
  text "With N Support" with the text "with N support".

  In the second sub-bullet under item 3 of the only list, replace the
  text "Without N Objections, With N Agoran Consent, or With Notice"
  with the text "without N objections, with N Agoran consent, or with
  notice".

  In the third sub-bullet under item 3 of the only list, replace the
  text "With T Notice" with the text "with T notice".

  In the final paragraph, replace the text "with N Agoran Consent"
  with the text "with N Agoran consent".

Amend the only list in Rule 2124 ("Agoran Satisfaction") to read:

  1. The action is to be performed Without N objections, and there are
  at least N Objectors to that intent.

  2. The action is to be performed With N support, and there are fewer
  than than N Supporters of that intent.

  3. The action is to be performed with N Agoran consent, and the
  number of Supporters of the intent is less than or equal to N times
  the number of Objectors to the intent.
