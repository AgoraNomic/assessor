Author: Murphy

Amend Rule 2692 (Bang!) by replacing "Bangs are a fungible asset." with
"Bangs are an untracked fungible asset."

Retitle Rule 2603 (Switch Responsibility) to "Default Recordkeepors",
and amend it by replacing "switch" with "switch or asset".

[Unchanged from proto. Encourages assets intended to be untracked to be
  explicitly labeled as such, otherwise materializes an officer, both in
  the same fashion as switches.]
