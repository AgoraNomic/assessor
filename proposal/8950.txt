[Overhaul the current stamp->radiance conversion to make it more
interesting, more in-line with the values of grindy sources of radiance,
and more distinct from the collection win:]

Amend R2659 by replacing:

       Any player CAN, once per week, pay X Stamps, where each specified
       Stamp is a different type, to gain (X^2)-X radiance.

       Any player CAN, once per week, pay X Stamps, where each Stamp is
       the same type, to gain (X-1)*2 radiance.

with:

       A stamp of a player's own type has a rarity of 1. A stamp of
       another player's type has a rarity of 2, and a stamp of a type
       that is not a current player has a rarity of 3.

       Once a week any player CAN perform one of the following actions:

         * Pay 3 specified stamps, where each stamp is of a different
           rarity to gain 12 radiance.

         * Pay 3 specified stamps, where each stamp is of rarity [1/2/3]
           to gain [5/10/20] radiance.

[This part is just a little fix for the scam snail pulled off:]

and by replacing:

       Any player CAN win by paying N Stamps

with:

       Any active player CAN win by paying N Stamps

[Stamps no longer accrue forever, and the wealth dream just gives a flat
number. Note that rounding down will always leave you with at least 1 of
each type, so you don't lose your collection but are still pressured to
spend excess:]

and by appending:

       At the beginning of each month, for each player, half (rounded
       down) of each type of stamp e owns is destroyed.


Amend R2675 by replacing:

       - Wealth: Immediately after a wandering, X stamps of eir own type
         are granted to each Wealth Dreamer. When less than 8 Stamps of
         eir type exist, X is 2. When 8 to 15 Stamps of eir type exist, X
         is 1. When 16 ore more Stamps of eir type exist, X is 0.

with:

       - Wealth: Immediately after a wandering, 2 stamps of eir own type
         are granted to each Wealth Dreamer.
