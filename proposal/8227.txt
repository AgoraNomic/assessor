If nch has publicly consented to abide by the rules in clear reference
to this proposal, and not withdrawn consent, then
Register nch and grant em 3 blots.

[Comment: Instead of withholding the welcome package, this version
uses blots, with the intention to prevent victory, as a more
appropriate penalty. I expect em to expunge all three approximately by
the time e would otherwise be able to register again.]
