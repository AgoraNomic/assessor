[Comment: use "with Notice" instead of writing it out.]

Replace the last paragraph of Rule 2472 ("Office Incompatibilities")
with the following paragraph:

  If a player is Overpowered, any player CAN, with Notice, Demand
  Resignation from em. When this occurs, each office that the
  Overpowered player holds becomes vacant.
