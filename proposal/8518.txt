Amend Rule 2577, "Asset Actions", by replacing:

  When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural
  number, the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural
  number.

with:

  When a rule indicates creating, destroying, or transferring an amount of
  assets that is not a natural number, the specified amount is rounded up
  to the nearest natural number after all other calculations.


Amend the Rule titled "Floating Rate Fleet" by deleting the text
"When a quantity of assets is expressed in boatloads, it is rounded up
to the next whole asset."
