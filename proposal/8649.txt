  The Mad Engineer is an office; its holder is responsible for
  building, tracking, and maintaining devices. Each device is a
  singleton switch with values off (default) and on. The Mad
  Engineer CAN flip a device to either on or off with Agoran
  Consent; any other player CAN do so with 2 Agoran Consent.

  The Mad Engineer CAN act on behalf of a device to take any
  action that that device may take, and SHALL act on behalf of a
  device to ensure that that device fulfills all of its duties.

  If there are ever no devices, then the Mad Engineer CAN create
  one by announcement, and SHALL do so in a timely fashion.
