Title: A possible patch for a peculiar persisting pledge paradox
Adoption index: 1.7

[A fix for pledge indeterminacy (see CFJ 3907). Defaults to the pledge
having been violated, as the infraction system seems to have enough
flexibility to forgive pledges that are broken on a technicality]

Amend Rule 2450 ("Pledges") by appending to the first paragraph as follows:
{
If it would otherwise be indeterminate whether a player has violated a
pledge, then e shall be deemed to have violated that pledge.
}
