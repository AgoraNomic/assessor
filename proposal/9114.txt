Amend Rule 2645 (The Stones) by replacing

{
      - Anti-Equatorial Stone (monthly): When wielded, the mossiest
        non-immune stone is transferred to the wielder. If more than one
        such stone is tied for mossiest, a specified one is transferred.
        When this happens, the wielded stone's mossiness is incremented
        by 1.
}

with

{
      - Grind Stone (quarterly): When wielded, if this is the 5th time the
wielder has wielded the Grind Stone (not the recursion stone) since any
other player wielded it, e wins the game.
}
