Title: Fairness in Crime Act
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet

Amend Rule 2478 ("Justice") by, as a single amendment:

{

Replacing "Within 14 days of an infraction being committed," with
"Within 14 days of an infraction being committed, or if the infraction
has been noted in the past 60 days,".

Then, replacing "any other player in the last 7 days" with "any other
player in the last 14 days".

}

[Harmonize the time limits to investigate and to note, and ensure a
noted infraction can always be investigated beyond the time limit to do
so (allowing deputization).]


Amend Rule 2531 ("Defendant's Rights") by, as a single amendment:

{

Appending a semicolon to the list item numbered (1), if it does not
already end in a semicolon.

Then, deleting the trailing " or" from the list item numbered (4).

Then, appending " or" to the list item numbered (5).

Then, appending the following to the first list: { (6) any available
non-null punishment would be blatantly and obviously unsuited to the
conduct which constitutes the infraction or to the person who committed
the infraction. }

Then, appending the following to the rule:

{

Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any attempt to investigate an
infraction which would result in the creation of blots is INEFFECTIVE if:

(1) it does not include the specific reason for the fine; or

(2) it would result in a punishment that is blatantly and obviously
unsuited to the conduct which constitutes the infraction or to the
person who committed the infraction.

}

}

[Restore the old "blatantly and obviously unsuited" standard to protect
defendants.]
