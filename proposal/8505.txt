Title: Card clarifications
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Janet

Amend Rule 2624 as follows:

  - Replace "The type of card with the fewest existing instances" with
    "The single type of card with the fewest existing instances (if any)"

  - Replace all instances of "the card's associated ministry" with "a
    ministry associated with the card".

[Right now the text assumes that each type of card has only a single
associated ministry, but this is not true because of the recent change
for the Ministry of Economy. There's also ambiguity with what happens if
multiple types of card are tied for fewest instances.]
