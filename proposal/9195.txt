[This is a useful but under-utilized mechanism; hopefully these tweaks
make it easier to build on.]

Amend rule 2681 (Acting on Commitment) by replacing:

       Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
       commitment" to a particular kind of document, that person performs
       that action by performing it by announcement while, in the same
       message, also publishing a what is purportedly a Fingerprint for a
       document of that kind.

with:

       A person CAN make a commitment to a particular kind of document
       by publishing a statement that purports to be a Fingerprint for a
       document of that kind. If the statement is in fact such a
       Fingerprint, the person CAN then reveal the commitment by
       publishing the Plaintext corresponding to that Fingerprint and
       clearly indicating which Fingerprint the Plaintext relates to.

       A person making a commitment SHOULD specify the method used to
       produce the Fingerprint from the Plaintext.
