Title: Double proposal application fix
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2034 by replacing the text "such a proposal existed, was
adopted, and took effect." with the text "such a proposal existed, was
adopted, and, if it had not previously taken effect, took effect.".

[Intended to make the consequences of Assessorial mishaps significantly
easier to deal with - this will insure that a proposal does not take
effect twice if an assessment is posted twice (the first time because it
succeeded platonically, the second time because of self-ratification).]
