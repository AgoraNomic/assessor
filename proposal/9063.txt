Amend Rule 2675 ("Dream of Wandering") by removing "active" from each of
the following:

   keeping track of the dreams of all active players.

from paragraph 1,

   Dream is * active player switch,

from paragraph 2, where * is "a secured" or "an" (respecting the outcome of
snail's clapping)

   every active player's Dream is set to the value

from paragraph 3

[ Comment: furthering the "inactive as an option" position to include
dreams. "Sharing" and "Revolution" behave a little strangely, but I believe
it will work out fine. Furthermore, it is intentional that only active
players may envision eir dream, and it is intentional that snail's clapping
is not modified to affect inactive players. ]
