If no proposal whose title contains the text "Administrative Adjudication"
has passed within the last 30 days, the remainder of this proposal has no
effect.

Create the following power 3.0 rule entitled "The Reset Button":

  An officer CAN, without 3 objections, pursuant to a memorandum finding it
  in the best interests of the game, issue an adjustment, which shall be
  a public document. When the adjustment is issued, all changes that are
  included in the adjustment take effect.

  This is a RECOMMENDED method for resetting aspects of the game in a
  fair and equitable manner following the discovery and/or exploitation
  of unintended loopholes within the Rules,  whether the exploitation
  was accidental or purposeful.
