Enact a rule with title "Laserwort", Power 1, and the text:

{{

   Laserwort (syn. laser, silphium) is a currency with ownership wholly
restricted to players and Agora and is tracked by the Florist. If any
amount of laserwort is owned by the Lost and Found Department or would
otherwise be in abeyance, it is transferred to Agora instead.

   The stock is defined as ten times the number of players.

   If the amount of laserwort that exists is ever greater than the
stock, then an amount owned by Agora equal to the difference is
destroyed (or as many as possible, if less). If the amount of laserwort
that exists is ever less than the stock, than an amount equal to the
difference is created in the possession of Agora.

}}

Amend Rule 2499 ("Welcome Packages") to include the following asset(s):
   - 5 laserwort

Grant to each player 5 laserwort.
