Title: Emergency Regulation Clarification
Adoption index: 3.1
Author: Jason
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2614 by replacing "Award Patent Titles not mentioned in any
Rule and Badges" with "Award Patent Titles that are either Badges or are
not mentioned in any Rule".

[Just a minor wording tweak, this has always looked weird to me.]
