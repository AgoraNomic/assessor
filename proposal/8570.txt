Title: Emergency Regulation Clarification
Adoption index: 3.1
Author: Jason

Amend Rule 2614 by replacing "Award Patent Titles not mentioned in any
Rule and Badges" with "Award Patent Titles that are either Badges or are
not mentioned in any Rule".

[Just a minor wording tweak, this has always looked weird to me.]
