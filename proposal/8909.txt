Title: Simplify the report report
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2138 (The Associate Director of Personnel) by replacing
item 4 and all text after it with this text:

       4. For offices with a weekly and/or monthly report, the date (if
          any) that each was most recently published.

[The existing items were added by Proposal 8679 last May, possibly at my
  suggestion; but I never got around to updating the ADoP automation to
  implement them, and no one seemed to notice. The proposed new item
  matches current practice, and is also useful for new officeholders
  attempting to catch up on relevant changes since the last report.]

  The rest of Proposal 8679 amended other rules defining Warnings and
  Tardiness.)
