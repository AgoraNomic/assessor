Title: Automatic Registration
Adoption index: 3.0

Amend Rule 869, "How to Join and Leave Agora", by replacing "desire to
become a player" with "desire to be a player".

COMMENTS:

This was suggested in Murphy's comments on CFJ 4100 subsequent to its
first judgement. The objective is to allow unregistered people who
believe they have already become registered just by signing up to the
mailing list to automatically become players when they attempt to take
an action by announcement, hopefully eliminating a common pitfall.

This legislatively overturns the precedent originally set by CFJ 3776
and reaffirmed by CFJ 4100.

I'm not certain this will be a popular change; it does represent a shift
in longstanding game custom. But Agora is a game about the rules
changing, and maybe it's time for this one to. At the least, I thought
it would be good to bring it to a vote.
