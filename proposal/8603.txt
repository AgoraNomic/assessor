Title: Buying Strength Eligibility
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: Bucky


Amend Rule 2653 by replacing "A player's Voting Strength on referendum"
with "A person's Voting Strength on a referendum".

[There's no reason that buying strength should stop applying on
deregistration, since a non-player can still be eligible to vote.]
