Title: Possibly-Indeterminate Switches
Adoption index: 3.0

Amend Rule 2162 ("Switches") by replacing the paragraph beginning "If an
action or set of actions" with the following:

  If a type of switch is not explicitly designated as
  possibly-indeterminate by the rule that defines it, and if an action
  or set of actions would cause the value of an instance of that type
  of switch to become indeterminate, that instance instead takes on
  its last determinate and possible value, if any, otherwise it takes
  on its default value.

[Provides an escape hatch so that rules can allow their switches to have
indeterminate values. This has come up in protos by both me and
Falsifian. It is useful to have these possibly-indeterminate properties
be switches, since switches have useful properties and precedent, so the
always-determinate system cuts off some use-cases.]
