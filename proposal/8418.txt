Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 1607, "Distribution", by replacing:

  Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision. For
  this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the adoption
  index is initially the adoption index of the proposal, or 1.0 if
  the proposal does not have one, and the text, author, coauthors,
  class and (if applicable) chamber of the proposal are essential
  parameters. Initiating such a decision is known as distribution,
  and removes the proposal from the Proposal Pool.

with:

  A referendum is the Agoran decision to determine whether to adopt a proposal.
  For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the adoption index is
  initially the adoption index of the proposal, or 1.0 if the proposal does not
  have one, and the text, author, coauthors, class and (if applicable) chamber
  of the proposal are essential parameters. Initiating a referendum is known
  as distribution, and removes the proposal from the Proposal Pool.

Amend Rule 879, "Quorum", by changing the text "the Agoran decision on whether
to adopt a proposal" to read "the referendum".

Amend Rule 2168, "Extending the voting period", by changing the text

Amend Rule 2496, Rewards, by changing the text "FOR the decision" to read

Amend Rule 2438, "Ribbons", by changing the text "an Agoran Decision" to

If the proposal entitled "Properly Prioritized Popular Proposal Proposer
Privilege" has passed:
  Amend the Rule entitled "Popular Proposal Proposer Privilege" by changing it
  to read in full:
    For a referendum, let F be the total number of valid ballots resolving to
    FOR, A be the same for AGAINST, and T be the total number of valid ballots.
    The referendum's popularity is equal to (F - A)/T. The Assessor SHOULD
    publish the popularity of each referendum when resolving it.

    The player who proposed the adopted proposal whose referendum had
    the greatest popularity among all referenda assessed in the last 7 days CAN
    once earn one Legislative Card by announcement, provided that no referendum
    initiated in the same message as it remains unresolved. If there is a tie,
    all authors of the tied proposals can do so once each.

  Amend the rule entitled "Popular Proposal Proposer Privilege" by
  changing the text "provided that no decision on whether to adopt any proposal
  distributed in the same message remains open." to read "provided that
  no referendum initiated in the same message remains open."
