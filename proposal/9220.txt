Amend Rule 2438, "Ribbons", by replacing this text:

        - If e has not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7
          days, any player CAN, by announcement, award em that type of
          Ribbon.

with:

        - If e has not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7
          days, e CAN, by announcement, award emself that type of
          Ribbon.

COMMENTS:

This was provoked by Mischief awarding me a Violet Ribbon just now.
This was profoundly annoying; I intended to leave it as long as possible
to award myself the ribbon, extending the period for which the Violet
Ribbon would count towards a Transparent Ribbon after I Raised my
Banner. Mischief also awarded a Violet Ribbon to several other people
who do not yet own a Transparent Ribbon, potentially making it more
difficult for them to do so in the future.

I suspect Mischief was not aware this would be negatively received,
believed e was doing people a favour, and will be disappointed to hear
otherwise. I think it would be less frustrating all around if this were
simply not possible. I don't think it is unreasonable to expect people
to notice they qualify for Ribbons in order to receive them.
