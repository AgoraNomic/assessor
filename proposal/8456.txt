enact a rule named "names" with the following text:

  "A player's legal nickname is 'CFJ X' where X is the number of the last
  CFJ they judged.  Failure to refer to someone by their legal nickname in
  public is the class-1 crime of 'oh I'm sorry, I thought you were 3805'.
   If they have never judged a CFJ, their nickname is 'Beverly'."
