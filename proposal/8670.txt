Amend R2629, Victory Auctions, to read (in full):

  The Treasuror CAN conduct a Victory Auction if no Victory Auction
  is ongoing. The Treasuror MUST do so at least once a month, and
  SHOULD do so at least twice each month.

  A Victory Auction includes the following lots:

  * one new Win Card.

  The currency of a Victory Auction is coins (minimum bid 1).

[Remove the L&FD lot. Also slightly clean up first paragraph.]

Enact a new Power=1 rule titled "L&FD Auctions" which reads (in full):

  The Treasuror CAN conduct a L&FD Auction if no L&FD Auction is
  ongoing. The Treasuror MUST do so at least once a month, if there
  is at least one asset in the Lost and Found Department of an
  auction-ready type.

  Coins, promises, and all private assets are excluded from L&FD
  Auctions. The non-excluded type(s) of asset(s) that the Lost and
  Found Department owns more of than any other type of non-excluded
  asset are auction-ready.

  When conducting a L&FD Auction, the Treasuror specifies an
  auction-ready asset type. Each asset of that type that the L&FD
  owns is a lot.

  The currency of a L&FD Auction is coins (minimum bid 1).

[This is generalized for nearly any asset, instead of just cards and
products. It also changes from one big pot to spreading out, which
gives a greater range of players access to these assets.]
