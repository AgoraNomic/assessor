[This is a different approach than I took with the June proposal. Rare
stamps just seem like too good of a concept to not do *something* with
them. For what it's worth, as of the submission of this proposal no
player is eligible to claim the title (several folks are tied).]

Create a rule entitled "Stamp Scamp" reading:

       A rare stamp is a stamp that is the only one of its type that
       exists.

       Upon a correct announcement that a specified player owns more
       rare stamps than any other player, the following happen in order:

         1) that player is awarded the patent title Stamp Scamp if e
         does not already hold it

         2) the patent title Stamp Scamp is revoked from any other
         person holding it

       Once per quarter a player holding the Stamp Scamp patent title
       CAN, by announcement, cause another specified player to gain one
       stamp of that specified player's type.
