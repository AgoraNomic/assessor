Title: Small Pledge Amendments

Amend rule 2450 "Pledges" by inserting the following sentence after
the words "explicitly states otherwise":
  {It is also Oathbreaking for a player to let a pledge expire without taking
  an action e pledged to do in that pledge.}

  Also amend the same rule by replacing the text
  {and should do so if and only if the pledge no longer serves any
  significant purpose.}
  with the new text
  {but SHOULD NOT do so unless the pledge no longer serves any significant
  purpose.}

  [Nonbinding comment: The first one is a very common type of pledge but I'm
  worried that they are unenforceable. This does not extend the time limit
  forever because it is a crime for the pledge to expire and there is a
  universal 14-day statute of limitations from that point. The second
  amendment is just to capitalize something that should be capitalised and
  make the sentence a bit better]
