In rule 2654, replace:
{{{
    * If a Device has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to
      judge that Device CAN assign it to emself without 3
      objections.
    * The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which
      e feels may be helpful in the use of the Device in the FLR.
    * Then, the Device changes, following which each active player
      gains 1 card of each type and eir grant (if any).
}}}

[The current version of the rule makes drastic changes to the economy
on a very vaguely defined trigger (possibly dependent on the
Rulekeepor's mental state) which might potentially be set off without
us realising it. This reorders the sections of the rule to make the
trigger something that we have more control over - this is the order I
had in mind when trying to construct the Device originally.]
