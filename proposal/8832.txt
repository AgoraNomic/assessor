Amend R2483, "Economics" by adding the following paragraph:

        Any player CAN, with Agoran Consent, "distribute" coins in the
        Lost and Found Department. When e does so, X/N coins, rounded
        down, are transferred from the Lost & Found Department to each
        active player, where X is the number of coins in the Lost & Found
        Department and N is the number of active players. E SHOULD
        announce how many coins each player receives when e does so.

For each coin balance, set that coin balance to one-tenth, rounded down,

their current respective values.
