Title: Gray Ribbon clarification
Adoption index: 3.0

[This is the only rule where "unless e has done so earlier in the month"
is used instead of "Once per month".

This proposal has two consequences:
   - Pending a CFJ (or precedent), the Tailor may be able to award two
Gray Ribbons in the month this is adopted.
   - In a month where the Tailor changes to a new player, e will likely
be unable to award a Gray Ribbon if the prior Tailor had done so that
month, where the previous version may have allowed it.
Seeing as Gray ribbons aren't exactly a hot commodity right now, I think
the simplicity is better than the potential extra award.]

Amend Rule 2438 ("Ribbons")by replacing
{
    The Tailor CAN award a Gray Ribbon by announcement, unless e has done
so earlier in the month.
}
with
{
    Once per month the Tailor CAN award a Gray Ribbon by announcement.
}
