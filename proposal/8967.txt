[This adds text with no real mechanical impact, but may clarify how we
would like elections to run for newer players.]

Amend R2154 (Election Procedure) by adding, after the first paragraph:

       Each candidate in an election is ENCOURAGED to campaign by
       indicating why e would be the best choice, and (if applicable)
       how e would run the office differently than the previous holder.
       The ADoP SHOULD remind candidates to campaign.
