Amend rule 2124 by replacing

  " A Supporter of an intent to perform an action is an eligible
  entity who has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support for an
  announcement of that intent. An Objector to an intent to perform
  an action is an eligible entity who has publicly posted (and not
  withdrawn) an objection to the announcement of that intent."


with

  " A Supporter of an intent to perform an action is an eligible
  entity who has supported and has not withdrawn their support for an
  announcement of that intent. An Objector to an intent to perform
  an action is an eligible entity who has objected to and has not
  withdrawn their objection to the announcement of that intent."

and by adding as a new paragraph at the very start of the rule

  "A person CAN support or object to an intent to perform an action by
  announcement and CAN withdraw support or objection by announcement."
