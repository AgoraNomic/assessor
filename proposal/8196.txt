[Comment: This clarifies the wording to explicitly use both the time
window and penalty specified in the Oath. This also specifies that
pledges can only be violated once.]

Amend the first paragraph of Rule 2450 ("Pledges") to read:

  If a Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to perform (or
  refrain from performing) certain actions, then breaking the pledge
  within the pledge's time window is the Class N crime of
  Oathbreaking. If the pledge specifically states that the pledge is
  under penalty of a Class A crime, where A is an integer not less
  than 1, then N is A; otherwise, N is 2. If the pledge specifically
  states that it operates only for a certain time window, and if that
  time window is prospective and not retrospective, then it operates
  only for that time window; otherwise, the pledge operates for 60
  days. It is impossible to commit the crime of Oathbreaking multiple
  times for a single pledge; breaking a single pledge multiple times
  constitutes a single crime.
