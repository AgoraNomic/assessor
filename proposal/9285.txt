Amend Rule 2683 (The Boulder) by replacing this text:

       The Boulder's Slope is a singleton integer switch defaulting to 1,
       tracked by the Absurdor.

       Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
       When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
       At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was pushed in the
       previous week at least as many times as the Boulder's Slope, then
       the Boulder's Slope is increased by 1; otherwise, the Boulder's
       Height is set to 0, and the Boulder's Slope is set to 1. The
       Absurdor SHOULD list the largest Height and Slope of the Boulder
       ever reached in eir report.

with this text:

       Each player CAN, by announcement, push the Boulder, unless e was
       the most recent player to do so. When a player pushes the Boulder,
       if e correctly and unambiguously specified its previous Height,
       then its Height is increased by 1; otherwise, its Height is set to
       0. At the beginning of each week, if the Boulder was not pushed in
       the previous week, then its Height is set to 0. The Absurdor
       SHOULD list the largest Height of the Boulder ever reached in eir
       report.

       Upon a correct announcement that the Boulder's Height is at least
       1000, each player who pushed it at least once since its Height was
       last 0 Reaches the Summit, then its Height is set to 0. When a
       player Reaches the Summit, e wins the game.

[Inspired by a Discord bot on another server that implements the same
  challenge. I've been watching it for a couple months now; it's failed
  in the 300-600 range about three times, one of which was my fault due
  to not scrolling down properly.]
