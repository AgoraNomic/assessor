The patent title Fugitive is hereby revoked from every person who
holds it.

Henceforth, the Herald SHOULD NOT list people as being "fugitives" in eir
reporting.  [covers any "unofficial" listees who didn't have patent titles].

[note: this may be slightly more controversial than last time, given that
we've uncovered some of those listed actually hold patent titles, and we
generally don't revoke those in order to preserve history. For full
disclosure, who actually holds that title could be reconstructed in a
fairly straightforward manner (I think I found the requisite proposal
records), if the consensus is to keep the patent title holders in the
Scroll].
