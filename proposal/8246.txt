Amend Rule 2532 ("Zombies") by replacing the sentence beginning "Master
is a secured player switch" with the following sentence:

  Master is a secured player switch, tracked by the Registrar, with
  possible values of any player, and Agora.


[This isn't currently made explicit at the definition of Master, but is
required by the last paragraph of Rule 2139.]
