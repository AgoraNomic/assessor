Do you want to be able to just send "ANGER" to a-b, and for it to mean "I
object to every intent to declare apathy."?
Or "I floop" to motivate the horses, or "Ohgodnotanother" to mean "I submit
the following proposal:"?

Well, now there's this rule! Enact it so you can do these things! WOW!
AMAZING!

Enact a rule entitled "Player-Defined Nonsense" with power=1.0 and the text:
{
The Madman is an office that tracks Player-Defined Nonsense.
The Handle is a secured player switch that contains text.
The Lookup is a secured player switch that contains text.
Each player CAN, once per week by announcement, set their Handle
to any text without whitespace that is not any other Handle.
Each player CAN, once per week by announcement, set their Lookup
to any text.

ONLY when interpreting game-actions (not reports, rules-text, proposal
text, CFJs, or the like),
for each instance of any Handle in full, surrounded by punctuation,
replace it with that player's Lookup.
}

But 4st, what about overwriting certain game actions?!
This isn't a bug, it's a feature!

Remember, always be voting!
