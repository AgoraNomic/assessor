       with the highest Modified Rockiness that reached for a stone in
       the previous week is transferred to em. In a tie, the stone

       transferred to the player (if any) with the highest Modified
       Rockiness that reached for that stone in the previous week,
       with ties broken in favor of the tied player who reached for
       that stone first. When a player receives a stone in this way,
       eir Base Rockiness is set to 0.
