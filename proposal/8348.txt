Title: Summaries Matter
Adoption index: 3.1
Author: Gaelan

Amend rule 1551 (“Ratification") by replacing the paragraph: {
  An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be ratified;
  however, if such a document can be divided into a summary section
  and a main section, where the only purpose of the summary section
  is to summarize information in the main section, and the main
  section is internally consistent, ratification of the document
  proceeds as if it contained only the main section.
} with: {
  An internally inconsistent document CANNOT be ratified.
}

[Rationale: Summaries, by their very nature, exist to save us the
trouble reading the rest of the document. If we have to read the
whole document to make sure it won’t accidentally ratify the wrong
thing, that defeats the purpose of having a summary in the first place.]
