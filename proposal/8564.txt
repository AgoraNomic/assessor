Title: Sponsorship is not Co-authorship
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Aspen
Co-authors: 


[It's always felt weird to me that pending a proposal now
makes you a co-author. That's not what co-authorship
means, IMO. Also, it goes against my mental invariant
that proposals are immutable after creation.]

Amend rule 2622, "Pending Proposals", by deleting the text:

  If the player did not create the proposal and is not
  listed in the list of co-authors of the proposal,
  e is added to the list of co-authors.

[For context, here's the current text of the paragraph:

  Any player CAN pay 1 Pendant to flip the Pended switch of a
  specified proposal to True. If the player did not create the
  proposal and is not listed in the list of co-authors of the
  proposal, e is added to the list of co-authors. When e does so,
  the proposal becomes sponsored.]
