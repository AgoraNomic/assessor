Title: No Taxation Without Representation
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: 4st

[Currently, democratic proposals can pass even if the quorum is much lower
than the number of active players. This means that democratic proposals
have the potential to not represent a representative amount of them.
Democratic proposals should not only meet a high adoption index, but should
also meet that adoption index with representation.]

Amend Rule 2606 ("Proposal Classes") by appending "The quorum of a
democratic proposal is 2/3 of the active players, rounded down."
