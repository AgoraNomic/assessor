Title: Talismans auction patch
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Trigon


Amend Rule 1885 by deleting the sentence beginning "The method to be
used for this auction".

[This fixes a specification bug in the talismans proposal, since
auctions are now supposed to have their method determined by the
auctioneer, rather than a rule. If talismans has not been adopted, then
this will have no effect.]
