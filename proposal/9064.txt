Amend Rule 2675 ("Dream of Wandering") by adding the following dream below
"Gardens"

- Erosion: The rockiest player is the non-Erosion Dreamer with the maximum
Base Rockiness (tie-broken alphabetically). Immediately after a wandering
occurs, if the total sum of Base Rockiness of Erosion Dreamers is less than
X-Y, where X is the Base Rockiness of the rockiest player, and Y is the
number of Erosion Dreamers, then decrease the Base Rockiness of the
rockiest player by Y-1, and increase the base rockiness of each Erosion
Dreamer by 1.

[ Comment: snail receives a co-authorship as e brought to my attention the
concern with the other two proposals that a player might stockpile Base
Rockiness for eir return. This inhibits that effort, and also introduces a
stronger interaction between reaching and a player's choice of Dream. ]
