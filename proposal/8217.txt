Amend Rule 2555 (Blots) by replacing:
  If a player has neither gained blots nor expunged any blots from
  emself in the current Agoran week, e CAN expunge 1 blot from
  emself by announcement.
with:
  If a person (the penitent) has neither gained blots nor had
  more than 2 blots expunged from emself in the current Agoran
  week, then any player (the confessor) who has not expunged
  any blots in the current Agoran week CAN expunge 1 blot from the
  penitent, by announcement.
