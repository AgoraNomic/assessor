Amend Rule 2645 ("The Stones") by replacing the list item beginning
"Mason's Stone" with the following:

{

- Mason's Stone (Monthly, 0): If the Mason's Stone is owned by the
Stonemason, its Mossiness is continuously set to 0. If the Mason's Stone
is owned by Agora, it is transferred to the Stonemason. When wielded, the
mossiest stone owned by Agora (or, if there is a tie, a specified stone tied
for the same) is transferred to the wielder.

}

[Currently, I'm effectively locked out of owning any actually useful
stone without setting a Dream, which isn't really fair. If I attempt to
get rid of the Mason's stone, it can be forcibly transferred back to me
or will eventually be automatically transferred back to me, resetting
the 30 day time limit again. I can't pawn it off on an inactive player,
since only active players can hold stones, and if I transfer it to an
active player I reset their stone delay, likely angering them and
probably just getting it transferred back. This change would allow me to
actually participate in the part of the stone game that allows doing
things with stones.]
