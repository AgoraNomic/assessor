Title: Kickstarter
Adoption index: 1.0

Each person who was a player when Rule 2668 (Horses) was enacted gains
10 dollaries.


[Another thing tied to "when the race starts anew", but the enactment of
these rules doesn't clearly qualify. The Registrar's report of August 14
should be sufficient to identify who gains dollaries, as there were no
registrations or deregistrations in between.]
