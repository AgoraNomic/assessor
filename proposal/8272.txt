Amend Rule 2193 (The Registrar) by removing this text:

  The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches,
  defined in a rule, that would otherwise lack an officer to track
  them, unless the switch is defined as untracked.

Amend Rule 2423 (First Among Equals) by removing this text:

  The Prime Minister is responsible for tracking any switches
  defined by the rules, not defined as untracked, and not defined
  as tracked by another officer.

Create a rule titled "The Fat Director" with Power 2 and this text:

  The Fat Director is an imposed office.

  A loose switch is a switch defined by the rules, not defined as
  untracked, and not defined as tracked by an officer other than the
  Fat Director. The Fat Director is responsible for tracking any
  loose switches.

  When a proposal creates a loose switch or causes a switch to
  become loose, the Fat Director is set to the author of that
  proposal. If the Fat Director is vacant and any loose switches
  exist, then the Registrar CAN set the Fat Director to any player
  by announcement. Any player CAN become the Fat Director by
  announcement.

[Would have called it "Fat Controllor", but that would be too close
to "Comptrollor", and I didn't want to merge it with that either.]
