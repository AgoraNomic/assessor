Amend Rule 2576 (Ownership) by replacing this text:

  If an asset's owner would otherwise be nonexistent, indeterminate,
  or invalid, then it is owned by the Lost and Found Department (if
  possible) or destroyed (otherwise), subject to modification by its
  backing document.

with this text:

  An asset "in abeyance" is one whose owner is nonexistent,
  indeterminate, or invalid. If an asset would otherwise be in
  abeyance, then it is owned by the Lost and Found Department (if
  possible) or destroyed (otherwise), subject to modification by its
  backing document (provided that the modification either destroys
  it or prevents it from being in abeyance).
