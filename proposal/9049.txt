Amend Rule 869 by, as a single amendment (in order):

* Replacing the text "No person can be a player if e is part of another
player or another player is part of em." with "Rules to the contrary
notwithstanding, two or more persons CANNOT become Registered
simultaneously.".

* Inserting the following paragraph after the paragraph beginning "An
Unregistered person CAN":

{

The basis of a person is the set of all persons that are (recursively)
part of em, in addition to emself. Rules to the contrary
notwithstanding, a person CANNOT become Registered if eir basis overlaps
with that of any current player.

}


[

This fixes a bug where two group persons [A B] and [B C] could be both
be players, since neither is a part of the other.

In order to let this work, this also prohibits simultaneous
registrations. This is done now because simultaneous registrations would
break the check for overlapping persons (if [A B] and [B C] could
register simultaneously, neither would overlap with any existing player,
even if they overlapped with each other). As a more general matter,
simultaneous registrations seem likely to result in bugs, and
registration order has been used as a tiebreak before (e.g. for Spaaace).
