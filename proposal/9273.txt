In rule 2709, before the last paragraph, add a new paragraph:
{{{
Once each week, the Land Managor SHALL randomly select and announce the
Weather for that week, which is either Good, Neutral, or Bad (each of
which has an equal probability). At the end of each week in which Bad
Weather was selected this way, all unharvested Crops are lost.
}}}
and amend the paragraph starting "Once per Crop" to read as follows:
{{{
Once per Crop that a player planted earlier in the current Crop
Season and at least <Growth Duration> days ago, e CAN harvest it
by announcement, gaining Pyrite equal to its Sell Price (exception: if
the Weather for the week e planted it had already been selected at the
time e planted it, e CANNOT harvest it before the end of the week after
the week e planted it).
}}}

[This is intended to reduce the potential for exponential growth in the
farming subgame by introducing a chance that planting crops will fail:
repeatedly investing everything means that eventually everything will
be destroyed by bad weather, so a prudent farmer will keep some
proportion of eir Pyrite back. It still probably grows exponentially,
but at least the strategy is more interesting.

This could potentially be expanded by listing out types of weather with
varying probabilities per season and having different crops respond to
different types of weather in different ways, but I didn't want to make
it unnecessarily complex.]
