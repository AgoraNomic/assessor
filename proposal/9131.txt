[The idea: create some differences in value among stamp types, open up some
possibilities for deals (what if someone owns the second to last copy of a
stamp?), encourage uncommon stamps to circulate, and try to discourage
large numbers of stamp types sticking around forever. If a player only has
a few rare stamps, when converting them to Radiance it's possible e will be
better off combining them with non-rare stamps via the existing redemption
mechanism. Also, stamps are destructible, so if someone only wants to
receive 1 stamp instead of 2 under the "pay 5 Spendies" mechanism e can
simply destroy one of them.]

Amend rule 2659 ("Stamps") by inserting after:

       Any player CAN, once per week, pay X Stamps, where each specified
       Stamp is a different type, to gain (X^2)-X radiance.

the paragraph:

       Any player CAN, once per week, pay X rare Stamps, where each
       specified Stamp is a different type, to gain (X^2)+X-2 radiance. A
       rare Stamp is a Stamp where exactly one of its type exists.
