In rule 103, delete
{{{
If at any time the office of Speaker is
vacant, or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime
Minister CAN once appoint a Laureled player to the office of
Speaker by announcement.
}}}
and, as a new paragraph immediately after the location from which that
text was deleted, add
{{{
The Prime Minister CAN by announcement appoint a Laureled player to the
office of Speaker if either of the following conditions apply:
a) the office of Speaker is vacant; or
b) the same person has been Speaker continuously since a player most
recently won Agora.
}}}
[The existing rule is unclear about when the win-created ability to
appoint a Speaker ends. For example, suppose a player wins twice in the
same message: under the existing rules that may create an obligation to
reinstall em as Speaker the next time a new Speaker is nominated for
non-win reasons, because only one of the two appointment permissions
was discharged at the time of eir original appointment.]
