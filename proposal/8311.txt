Title: Rewards Patch & Equitable Remedy
Adoption index: 1.0

Amend Rule 2496, "Rewards", by replacing "CAN once" with "CAN once by
announcement".

Amend Rule 2602, "Glitter", by replacing "CAN once" with "CAN once by
announcement".

For the purposes of this proposal, the "recession" is defined as the
period of time starting at 03:00 am UTC on 29th January 2020 and ending
the instant before the adoption of this proposal.

For each time a player met a reward condition during the recession,
grant that player the assets associated with the reward condition, or
if e is no longer a player, grant the same assets to the Lost and Found
Department.

For each time a player was awarded Glitter during the recession, grant
that player a quantity of coins determined in the manner specified by
Rule 2602, or if e is no longer a player, grant the same quantity to the
Lost and Found Department.

[This ensures no loss of coins, but shifts the responsibility for
 evaluating the missed rewards onto the Treasuror. Which is fair enough
 because it's mostly my fault. I say "mostly" because nobody else caught
 it in drafting either.]
