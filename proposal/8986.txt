/*Comment: I'm fine with rewarding officers and such with more voting
power, but it seems obscene to me when certain players can have almost four
(4!!!) times the voting power of a newbie. It's too greedy, too
controlling, too much.

Let's give everyone a more equal chance to be relevant.

This is the high AI version. This is tidier, as it keeps it all in the same
rule, but it would be harder to pass/easier to block because of its
enormous AI requirement.*/

If the Proposal named "Democratization (low AI version)" is ADOPTED, then
this Proposal does nothing. Otherwise:

Amend the first paragraph of Rule 2422 (Power 3) to read in full:

{The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an integer
between 0 and 15 inclusive, defined by rules of power 2 or greater. If not
otherwise specified, the voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision
is 8.}
