=Administrative Law Reform. II. Temporary Suspension of Rules=

If no proposal entitled "Statutory Instrumentation" has taken effect
in the previous month, this proposal has no effect. If this proposal
has already taken effect, it has no effect.

Amend Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) by appending a new paragraph
reading "A proposal CAN override the effect of any rule which it
is capable of amending by specifying that it does so."

[This is a small side proposal to allow proposals to temporarily
override rules without having to do so by the enactment and subsequent
repeal of a helper rule. It must be explicit.]
