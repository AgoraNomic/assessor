ID: 8579
Title: AI voting method clarification v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Trigon


If Rule 1950 contains the text 'For any Agoran decision with an adoption
index', amend Rule 1950 by replacing the text 'For any Agoran decision
with an adoption index' with 'For any Agoran decision with a non-"none"
adoption index'.

[Legislates the decision in CFJ 3746. All Agoran decisions possess an
adoption index switch, but some of them have the value "none". Now with
less ambiguous quotation marks!]
