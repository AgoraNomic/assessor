Amend Rule 1698 (Agora Is A Nomic) by replacing:
      adopted within a four-week period.
with:
      adopted within a real-world (UTC) four-week period.

[
In discord, a Power-5 Rule was suggested: "Rules to the contrary
notwithstanding, this rule CANNOT be changed in January or February of
2023".

Up until the time a proposal to change this rule could take effect before
January 2023, Agora would not be ossified. But then you cross a time
boundary and Agora would become ossified. One *possible* interpretation of

>      If any other single change or inseparable group of changes to the
>      gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
>      Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
>      to the contrary notwithstanding.

is that the "cancelled change" would be time passing!  With the conclusion
that time had (as a legal fiction) stopped, with no way of getting it
started again. So this proposal puts an extra protection on time by making
it clear that only "real world" time is relevant. The title a reference B
nomic, an established nomic some years back that was killed when they
accidentally stopped time or at least couldn't get it started again.
