[ Comment: It is not unusual for the final draft of a proposal to be
   submitted by someone other than the person who did most of the
   drafting for that proposal. These proposals have, in several
   instances, made it to the finals. Notably, during the Silver Quill
   2020 discussions, an honorable mention was given to Interesting
   Chambers, which I wrote and did revisions on but never wrote the final
   version of. This kind of stuff has happened before. It isn't too
   worrying, but it would be nice to not have to work around it. Plus,
   proposals are cheap. ]

Amend Rule 2582 by replacing:

  - Silver Quill, awardable by the Promotor to the author of a
    proposal of outstanding merit and influence on the game
    (additional information: ID Number of the proposal).

with:

  - Silver Quill, awardable by the Promotor to the author of a
    proposal of outstanding merit and influence on the game, or to
    a coauthor, although e SHOULD only do so if it is generally
    agreed that that coauthor contributed more to that proposal
    than the person who submitted it (additional information: ID
    Number of the proposal).
