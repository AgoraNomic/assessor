Title: Fix truthfulness loophole

In rule 2471, replace
"The author believed the statement to be not true."
with
"The author did not believe the statement to be true."

[Under the existing rules, it's possible to legally make a statement
under penalty of No Faking, when you have no idea whether or not the
statement is true â€“ neither of the existing clauses apply, because you
neither believe it to be not true, nor should have known that it was
false. This makes the "penalty of No Faking" ineffective for one of its
primary purposes, of allowing people to introduce new facts into the
judicial record based on their own personal knowledge.]
