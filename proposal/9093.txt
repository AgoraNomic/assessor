Title: Stamp down on crime
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: ais523

Amend rule 2555 by removing the following text, if present:
{{{
      Any player who has not expunged a blot by this method this week
      CAN expunge 1 blot from a specified player by announcement. E
      CANNOT specify emself for this if e has gained any blots this or
      the previous week.
}}}
Amend rule 2555 by adding the following text, as a new paragraph, prior
to its last sentence:
{{{
      Any player CAN, with notice, pay a fee of 11 Spendies to revoke
      a blot from a specified person. When a blot is revoked this way,
      a Stamp with type corresponding to the person from whom the blot
      was revoked is created in the possession of the player who
      revoked it.
}}}
[A less straightforward "get fined for crimes" mechanic, which could
combine well with my other proposal: the risk of someone else gaining
one of your stamps (leading to a minor but semi-permanent loss of
economic power) serves as an incentive to remove blots, and as a
potential punishment in its own right.]
