Amend Rule 1607 "Distribution" by deleting the paragraph:

  The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
  Proposal Pool, along with their text and attributes. This portion
  of a public document purporting to be a Promotor's report is
  self-ratifying.

then by replacing:

  If a proposal has been in the proposal pool for more than 7 days
  and is not pending, the Promotor CAN and SHOULD remove it from the
  Pool by announcement.

with:

  The Promotor CAN Drain the Pool by announcement. When e does so,
  each proposal in the Proposal Pool that was there for the entirety
  of the previous Agoran month is destroyed. E SHOULD do so once
  each month.

Amend Rule 2496 "Rewards" by adding a bullet point to the list, before
the one beginning "Publishing an office's weekly or monthly report" that
reads:

  * Initiating a referendum, provided that no other referendum had
    been initiated earlier in that Agoran week: 5 coins (ADoP)
