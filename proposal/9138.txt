Title: Stone cost adjustments
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2642 by, as a single amendment:

* Appending the following to the paragraph beginning "Any player CAN": "
When this occurs, the stone cost of that stone is set to its default
value.".

* Replacing the paragraph beginning "At the beginning of each week" with
the following paragraph:

{

At the beginning of each Agoran week, the Stone Cost of each stone is
decreased by 1 (to a minimum of 1). When a stone is transferred to
Agora, its Stone Cost is reset to its default value.

}


[Go back to something close to the old system, since the current system
just results in stone costs decreasing forever. Slightly tweaked so
that, e.g., the Soul Stone doesn't reset costs. If you want the
protection of the higher cost, you should have to pay for it.]
