[This proposal quotes text that explicitly includes both references, so
this should be safe against unintended conflicts with other changes.]

Amend rule 1950 (Decisions with Adoption Indices) by, in the text reading:

       Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
       decisions and proposals, secured at power 2.  For decisions, the
       possible values are "none" (default) or integral multiples of 0.1
       from 1.0 to 9.9. For proposals, the possible values are integral
       multiples of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9 (default 1.0).

       The adoption index of a referendum CANNOT be set or changed to
       "none" or to a value less than that of its associated proposal. If
       a referendum ever has an adoption index of "none" or an adoption
       index less than that of its associated proposal, it is immediately
       set to the adoption index of the associated proposal.

       Adoption index is secured with a Power Threshold of 2.

deleting the sentence "Adoption index is secured with a Power Threshold of
2."
