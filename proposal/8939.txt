[The current calculations are needlessly complex. These calculations are
simpler and hopefully still fair.]

Amend R2675 by replacing:

       - Charity: A Charity Stamp is a stamp of the type that the L&FD
         owns the most of (if there is a tie, the first the L&FD owned,
         and if still tied, the first alphabetically). Immediately after
         a wandering, for each Charity Dreamer, in reverse order of when
         eir Dream was last flipped (and in reverse order of registration
         if tied), one Charity Stamp is transferred from the L&FD to em.
         If the number of Stamps the L&FD owned during the last wandering
         is greater than 10, this process happens a second time. If it is
         more than 20, this process happens a third time.

with:

         - Charity: Immediately after a wandering, one stamp (chosen by
         most-to-least owned by the L&FD at time of transfer, tie-broken
         alphabetically) is transferred to each Charity Dreamer (in order
         from least-to-most stamps owned, tie-broken alphabetically) from
         the L&FD. If the number of Stamps the L&FD owned during the last
         wandering is greater than 10, this process happens a second
         time. If it is more than 20, this process happens a third time.
