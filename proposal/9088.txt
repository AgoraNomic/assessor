[Spendies v1.1 both failed to repeal R2643 and may have accidentally
repealed 2642. This proposal fixes both of those.]

Reenact R2642 (Stone Cost) with a Power of 2 and the full text:

    Stone Cost is a Stone switch with values of non-negative integers
    and a default of 10. Stone Cost is tracked by the Stonemason.

    Any player CAN pay a fee of X Spendies to transfer a specified stone
    to emself, where X is the current Stone Cost of the specified stone.

    When a stone is transferred, its Stone Cost is set to the default.
    At the beginning of every week, the Stone Cost for each stone is
    reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0.

[If the rule is repealed, this brings it back. If the rule isn't
repealed, it does nothing.]

Repeal R2643 (Collecting Stones).

If no player has any Spendies, grant each player 20 Spendies.

[Get Spendies running properly if they aren't already.]
