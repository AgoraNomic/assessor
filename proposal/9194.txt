[Untracked subgames and variables with long histories are a bad
combination.]

Amend rule 2697 (The Bounty Board) by adding at the end as a new paragraph:

       A player CAN wipe the slate clean by announcement if the match
       state is none and no one has done so in the current quarter. Upon
       doing so, all bounty amounts are flipped to zero.
