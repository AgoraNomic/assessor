Create a Power 1.0 rule called “The Button” with text:
{
The Buttonmastor is an office.

The Button is a singleton switch tracked by the Buttonmastor with instants
in time as possible values, defaulting to the instant this rule was created.

Buttonclass is a player switch tracked by the Buttonmastor with possible
values Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet or None, defaulting
to None.

A player CAN, once a week, by announcement, press the button.

When a player presses the button, two things happen:

1. The Button is flipped to the instant e did it.

2. That player's Buttonclass is flipped to a value depending on the amount
of hours passed between the previous value of The Button and the current
one, as specified below:

* Less than 24: Red;
* 24 or more, but less than 48: Orange;
* 48 or more, but less than 72: Yellow;
* 72 or more, but less than 96: Green;
* 96 or more, but less than 120: Blue;
* 120 or more, but less than 144: Indigo;
* 144 or more: Violet.

If value of The Button is more than 168 hours in the past, this rule
repeals itself.

Players are ENCOURAGED to brag on their Buttonclass.
