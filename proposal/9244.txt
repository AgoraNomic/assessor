[Proposals can't all be epochal rewrites like "Agoriculture"

As a reminder, even though rule 2614 is power 3.1, this proposal only
needs to be power 3 to satisfy rule 2140.]

Amend rule 2614 (Eclipse Light) by replacing:

       If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least
       a month and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in
       the past month, any player CAN, with 7 days notice, cause this
       rule to repeal all Emergency Regulations.

       If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least
       a month and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in
       the past month, any player CAN, with 7 days notice, repeal all
       Emergency Regulations.
