Amend Rule 2582 (Annual Awards) by replacing:
{
      The following Patent Titles CAN be awarded by the indicated
      Officers with 2 Agoran consent, provided the intent to make
      the awards is announced during awards month, and the award is
      made to commemorate acts performed in the previous Agoran year.
      The full name of each awarded Patent Title is [Title Below] NNNN,
      where NNNN is the year each act was performed.
}
with
{
      The following Patent Titles CAN be awarded by the indicated Officers
with 2 Agoran consent. The Patent Titles SHOULD be awarded during Awards
Month, and the award SHOULD be made to commemorate acts performed in the
previous Agoran year. The full name of each awarded Patent Title is [Title
Below] NNNN, where NNNN is the year each act was performed.

The Herald SHALL announce it is Awards Month in an officially timely
fashion after it begins. E SHOULD petition officers to award their awards
if they have not done so by the end of Awards Month.
}.

[The restriction on making award intents during Awards Month causes more
problems than it's worth: this version is more flexible in case deadlines
are missed and adds herald-induced reminders to get the awards out on time.]
