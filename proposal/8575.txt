Title: Stone Win Delay v2
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: Gaelan


Amend Rule 2644 to read, in whole:

{

  A player CAN, by announcement, Notice the Gauntlet, specifying a single
  player that owns 5 or more stones, provided that no person has done so
  in the past 30 days.

  When the Gauntlet is Noticed, the specified player wins the game. If the
  Gauntlet was Noticed 4 days ago, then all existing stones are
  transferred to Agora.

}


[Adds a delay to stone wins to bring it inline with VP wins. Also adds a
prevention for rapid-fire stone wins. This doesn't allow the bearer of
many stones to prevent the win, in order to maintain a balance of stone
power.]
