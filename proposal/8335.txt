Amend Rule 2154 (Election Procedure) by appending to this text:

  If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
  then any player CAN by announcement declare em the winner of the
  election, thereby causing em to win the election. If at any point
  an uncontested election has no candidates, then any player CAN
  declare the election ended with no winner by announcement.

this text:

  In each of these cases, the ADoP SHALL so announce in a timely
  fashion, unless someone else has already done so.

[I think the recent resolutions of Treasuror and Tailor, while still
effective resolutions, didn't count as temporary deputisation because
the ADoP wasn't required to do them.]
