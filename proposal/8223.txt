Destroy each contract the full text of which has not been posted in
public. If this destroyed Agora, put it back again the same as it was.
Nobody will be able to tell the difference.

Amend the rule "Contracts" by changing "Such an agreement is known as a
contract." to "When the full text of such an agreement is posted in public,
it is known as a contract"
