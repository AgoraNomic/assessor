If Proposal 9230 (Agoriculture) has not been adopted, this proposal has
no effect.

Amend the rule titled "Pyrite" by replacing the text:

     Pyrite is a type of fixed asset

with:

     Pyrite is a type of fixed fungible asset

[Comment: This is presumably the intended use of Pyrite as a currency.
Also, it saves the Land Managor the work of tracking each Pyrite
individually, especially since there can be thousands of them.]
