Title: Repairing Defeated Spaceships v3
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: twg, Jason


Amend Rule 2595 by replacing the text "Any player CAN, by
announcement, spend a coin to increase the Armour of a Pilotable
Spaceship e owns by 1." with the text "Any player CAN pay a fee of 1
coin to increase the Armour of a Pilotable Spaceship in eir possession
by 1 or pay a fee of 3 coins to increase the Armour of a Defeated
Spaceship by 1."

[Comment: Right now, Defeated Spaceships are effectively dead forever.
If a player goes all out and kills the other person's Spaceship, they
are effectively banished from the subgame forever. To solve this, a
slight penalty is added for repairing a Defeated spaceship. The number
of coins remains small because it is just a subgame.]

Amend Rule 2591 by replacing the text "Spaceships are a class of fixed
asset" with "Spaceships are a class of fixed indestructible asset".

[Change from the original: "pay... 1 coin increase" -> "pay... 1 coin to
increase"]
