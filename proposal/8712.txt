Enact a new rule with title "Balancing Act" and the following text:
{

"Stone Above" is a stone switch tracked by the Stonemason with possible
values
of any stone and none (default).

A stone's props are any stones that have that stone or any of that stone's
props as a their value of Stone Above.

If a stone's Stone Above is ever one of its props, its Stone Above is set
to
none.

A stone that has 3 or more props is immune.

When a stone is wielded, the wielder CAN cascade one of that stone's props
by
announcement in the same message, specifying any values needed to interpret
the
prop's effects.

When a stone is cascaded, the Rule defining that stone applies the effects
in
that stone's scroll.

A player CAN set the Stone Above of a stone they own to another stone they

with 13 days notice, provided e has not set a Stone Above switch in the
past 14
days.

[Note intents expire after 14 days.]
