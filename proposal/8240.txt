Title: Regulation clarification

[Comment: Currently, R2493 reads as if any person who happens to be
Promulgator can enact/amend/repeal _any_ regulation (without otherwise
specified rules) with 2 Agoran Consent. While not the most serious bug,
it's probably not what was intended.]

Amend Rule 2493 ("Regulations") as follows:

  Replace the sentence beginning "By default" with the sentence
    By default, a person CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, enact, amend,
    or repeal a regulation for which e is the Promulgator.
