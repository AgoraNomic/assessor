Amend Rule 2683 (The Boulder) by replacing this text:

       Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
       When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
       At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was not pushed in
       the previous week, the Boulder's Height is set to 0.

with this text:

       Each player CAN, once a week, pay a fee of N + 1 spendies to push
       the Boulder, where N is the number of times e has already done so
       that month. When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is
