If the proposal titled "Rewards Reform Act" has not been adopted, this
proposal has no effect.

Amend Rule 1023, "Agoran Time", by inserting the following top-level
list item before the one starting "2. Agoran epochs:", and renumbering
the rest of the list as appropriate:

2. The phrase "in an officially timely fashion" means "before the
   end of the next Agoran week". This time period is set when the
   requirement is created (i.e. between 7 and 14 days before the
   period ends).

Amend Rule 2496, "Rewards", by replacing "before the end of the next
Agoran week" with "in an officially timely fashion".

Amend Rule 2602, "Glitter", by replacing "before the end of the next
Agoran week" with "in an officially timely fashion".
