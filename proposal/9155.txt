Amend Rule 2644 (Zen Gardening) by replacing this text:

        A player has an impressive rock collection if e:
          1) owns 10 or more stones; or
          2) owns 8 or more stones and does not own the Tacky Stone.

with this text:

        A player has an impressive rock collection if e owns one or more
        stones with a total Stature of at least 8. The Stature of each
        stone is 1, unless its definition specifies otherwise.

Amend Rule 2645 (The Stones) by replacing this text:

        - Tacky Stone (monthly):

with this text:

        - Tacky Stone (monthly, Stature -1):

[Generalizes the "Tacky Stone is beyond worthless" mechanism, in case
  we want to bump the Stature of any other stones up or down. No effect
  if Tacky Stone wasn't adopted.]
