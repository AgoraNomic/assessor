Amend Rule 2657 by, as a single amendment, removing the list items and
bullet points for the list items starting with each of the following:
"Charity", "Sharing, "Wealth".

Repeal Rule 2499 ("Welcome Packages").

Repeal Rule 2659 ("Stamps").

Repeal Rule 2680 ("Ritual Paper Dance").

Repeal Rule 2656 ("Radiance").


[Given a new player winning within a month and a half by stamps by
simply trading, something needs to change, and with no other radiance
conditions existing, something needs to change. It doesn't need to be
this, and I don't necessarily *want* it to be this, but the status quo
is clearly not working.]
