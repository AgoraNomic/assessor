Amend rule 2496 by replacing the current text {

  * Publishing an office's weekly or monthly report, provided that
    publication was the first report published for that office in
    the relevant time period (week or month respectively) to fulfill
    an official weekly or monthly duty: 5 coins.

} with the text {

  * Publishing an office's weekly or monthly report, provided that
    publication was the first report published for that office in
    the relevant time period (week or month respectively) to fulfill
    an official weekly or monthly duty: 3 coins for an interim office
    or 5 coins for any other office.

}

Reasoning: This should encourage elections for offices. Elections are Fun
and Cool and help spread the workload and reduce consolidation.
