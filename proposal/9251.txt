Title: Regulated simultaneity

Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 478 by replacing the text "Allowing actions performed by
sending a message to take place simultaneously" with the text "Allowing
regulated actions performed by sending a message to take place
simultaneously".

[Clarify an old wording ambiguity that ais523 pointed out that
potentially makes this restriction overbroad.]
