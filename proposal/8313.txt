Amend Rule 2124 (Agoran Satisfaction) by:

  1. Replacing "However, the previous sentence notwithstanding, the initiator
     of the intent is not eligible to support it." with "Announcing intent to
     perform an action implicitly announces support for that action; such
     support may be withdrawn as per usual."
  2. Replacing "The action is to be performed With N support, and there are
     fewer than than N Supporters of that intent." with "The action is to be
     performed With N support, and there equal to or fewer than than N
     Supporters of that intent."
  3. Replacing "The action is to be performed with N Agoran consent, and
     the number of Supporters of the intent is less than or equal to N times the
     number of Objectors to the intent." with "The action is to be performed
     with N Agoran consent, and the number of Supporters of the intent is less
     than or equal to O or less than N * O, where O is the number of Objectors
     to the intent."
