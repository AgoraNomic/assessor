Amend Rule 2438 (Ribbons) by replacing "Cyan (C): When a person
deputises for an office, that person earns a Cyan Ribbon" with
"Cyan (C): When a person deputises for an office, and that person has not
held or deputized for that office within the past 7 days, that person earns
a Cyan Ribbon".

[Fixes an issue which lets a player repeatedly deputize for an office and
award emself up to 5 cyan glitter.]
