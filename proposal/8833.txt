Enact a new rule titled "Etiquette" at P=0.5 with the following text:

       Officers SHOULD:

         - publish dates in YYYY-MM-DD or DD Mon YY format in reports,
           whichever is more fitting to the situation;

         - communicate a schedule of when regularly timed duties will
           usually be done;

         - maintain an online version of eir report(s) in a
           browser-native format (such as html); AND

         - maintain a repository of eir report(s) in a public place.

       Players SHOULD:

         - signal the official name of the primary action and/or the
           relevant officer that tracks said actions in the title of a
           public message; AND

         - be kind.

Amend R2143, "Official Reports and Duties", by removing:

       Officers SHOULD maintain a publicly visible copy of their reports
       on the World Wide Web, and they SHOULD publish the address of this
       copy along with their published reports.
