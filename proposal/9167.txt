Enact a new Rule with title "Bounties" and the following text:
{
Bounty Amount is an untracked player switch. Its possible values are all
integers from 0 to 10 inclusive, where 0 is the default.

Twice each month, each player CAN, by announcement, put a bounty on a
specified player. Doing so increases the specified player's Bounty Amount
by 1.

Immediately after an alive player is eliminated, the shooter gains a number
of spendies equal to the target's Bounty Amount, and then the target's
bounty amount is flipped to 0.

The shooter SHOULD publish the target's Bounty Amount at the time of the
elimination when e eliminates a target with a non-zero Bounty Amount.
}
