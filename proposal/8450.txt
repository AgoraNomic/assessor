Amend Rule 591 (Delivering Judgements) by appending the following
paragraph:

  If the judge of an open CFJ has not violated a time limit for
  assigning it a judgement, and has not previously filed a motion
  to either extend or reconsider the case, e CAN file a motion to
  extend the case by announcement. Doing so extends eir judgement
  deadline for that case by one week. In doing so, e SHOULD include
  a (nonbinding) draft or outline of eir current thoughts on the
  case.

[Self-filed motions to reconsider have been used a handful of times for
the above.  Might as well make it official, removes the Arbitor's
guesswork on when to reassign a late case.  Policy statement: the flip
side is that, as Arbitor I'd be more strict on reassignment deadlines
for people who are late without requesting the extension].
