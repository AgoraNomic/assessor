Revoke the Patent titles "Prince of Agora" and "Princess of Andorra" from
Alexis, and award em the Patent titles "Prince of Andorra" and "Princess of

[At some point, these appear to have been swapped in Herald's reports.
Since the report was ratified since the mistake was made, a proposal is
necessary to fix them.]
