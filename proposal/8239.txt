[Comment: Creates a new role, the Editor, who is the same person as the
Rulekeepor and which is responsible for promulgating regulations
(Editorial Guidelines) about non-substantive elements of the Ruleset.
Currently, guidelines are not written down anywhere official, which
probably contributes to the inconsistency arising in the first place.]

Enact a new Rule with power 1, title "The Editor", and text as follows:

  The Editor is the same person, if any, as the Rulekeepor.

  The Editor CAN, with Agoran consent, enact regulations, collectively
  called "Editorial Guidelines". The Editor CAN, with Agoran consent,
  repeal and amend Editorial Guidelines. The Editor is the Promulgator
  for all Editorial Guidelines.

  Editorial Guidelines SHOULD pertain only to matters that affect
  non-substantive aspects of the Rules, e.g. capitalization or
  spelling. Editorial Guidelines CANNOT place any enforceable
  requirements upon any player and CANNOT cause any changes to the
  gamestate. Whether or not the text of a textual entity conforms to
  the Editorial Guidelines SHOULD NOT affect the interpretation of
  that entity.

  When writing proposals and enacting or amending regulations, players
  SHOULD follow all reasonable directives that are set out in the
  Editorial Guidelines.

  Causing an Editorial Guideline to be inconsistent with any other
  Editorial Guideline is the Class 1 Crime of Editorial Hypocrisy.
