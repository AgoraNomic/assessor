Amend Rule 2559 (Paydays) by replacing this text:

  2. For each office, if a single player held that office for 16 or
     more days in the previous month and no unforgivable fines were
     levied on em for eir conduct in that office during that time,
     that player earns 5 coins.

[Legislates based on the judgement of CFJ 3774, but also covers edge
cases like "do something in late September, get dinged for it in early
October": you still earn your salary for September, but forfeit it for
October. Covering corner cases like "exit office in early October,
no October salary to forfeit, impose fine/debt against September salary"
is left as an exercise for future proposal authors.]
