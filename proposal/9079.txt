Title: Spendies v1.1
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: nix
Co-authors: Janet, kiako


[Spendies are simple. We all start with the same amount every month,
and if you don't use them you lose them. You can transfer them, put
them in contracts, etc. But they will go away. What's important is what
you do with them in that month.]

Enact a new (Power=1) rule titled Spendies with the text:

    Spendies are a currency ownable by players and contracts. Spendies
    are tracked by the Spendor in eir weekly report.

    At the end of each month, all Spendies are destroyed. At the
    beginning of each month, every player is granted 20 Spendies.

[Quick compatibility with another proposal]

If a proposal titled "FUNgibility" and authored by nix has been adopted
within the last 90 days, amend the rule titled "Spendies" to replace
"currency" with "fungible liquid asset".

[Delete dream of wandering.]

Repeal R2675 (Dream of Wandering).

[Below stones are simplified, similarly to the stamp specialization
proposal I made previously. You simply buy them for a cost that
decreases every month while the stone has the same owner.]

Amend R2640 (Stones) by replacing:

    A stone is a unique indestructible liquid asset

with:

    A stone is a unique indestructible fixed asset

and deleting its last two paragraphs.

Amend R2641 (Wielding Stones) by replacing:

    While a stone is hot, it is IMPOSSIBLE to wield it or to transfer it
    by announcement.

with:

    While a stone is hot, it is IMPOSSIBLE to wield it.

Retitle R2642 (Gathering Stones) to "Stone Cost" and then amend R2642 to
read in full:

    Stone Cost is a Stone switch with values of non-negative integers
    and a default of 10. Stone Cost is tracked by the Stonemason.

    Any player CAN pay a fee of X Spendies to transfer a specified stone
    to emself, where X is the current Stone Cost of the specified stone.

    When a stone is transferred, its Stone Cost is set to the default.
    At the beginning of every week, the Stone Cost for each stone is
    reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0.

Repeal R2642 (Gathering Stones).

[Similarly, let's include stamps. Remember Dreams are gone, so this is
now the primary way to get new stamps. Use Spendies to get stamps from
L&FD, or mint more of your own. There's some modifications to the cost
to account for scale, which also discourages timing scams somewhat.]

Amend R2659 (Stamps) by appending the following paragraphs:

    Any player CAN pay a fee of 5 Spendies to grant emself X stamps of
    eir own type. When less than 8 Stamps of eir type exist, X is 2.
    When 8 to 15 Stamps of eir type exist, X is 1. When 16 or more
    stamps of eir type exist, X is 0.

    Any player CAN pay a fee of 5 + (X) Spendies to transfer a
    specified stamp from the L&FD to emself. X is equal to the number of
    times e has already done so in the current month.

[Finally, you can buy some radiance, tho the cost is fairly high. Might
push you across the finish line tho, or at least give a use for some
spare Spendies.]

Amend R2656 (Radiance) by appending the following paragraph:

    Any player CAN increase eir radiance by 1 by paying a fee of 2
    Spendies.
