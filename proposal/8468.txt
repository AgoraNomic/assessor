Amend Rule 208 by replacing the text "To be valid, this announcement
must satisfy the following conditions" with the text "To be EFFECTIVE,
such an attempt must satisfy the following conditions".

[This resolves a potential bug that *may* permit the vote collector of a
decision to resolve it without adhering to the conditions in the
numbered list of Rule 208 based on the precise wording of how the
conditions are enforced. The argument that they don't work is that the
sentence doesn't sufficiently override R208's earlier statement that
"The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve it by
announcement, indicating the outcome.", because it describes the
announcement, rather than the attempt itself.

Even if that interpretation is wrong, there is enough of an ambiguity
that it should be resolved. The new wording makes this clearer by
describing the /attempt/ as INEFFECTIVE (clearly overriding the earlier
CAN) rather than the "announcement".]
