requirement to select a new Comptrollor persists. The replacement text
is also considerably more compact.]

list of Cabinet Orders:

  - Line Item Veto (Assessor): The Prime Minister clearly, directly,
    and without obfuscation identifies one or more individual
    changes in proposals whose decision's voting periods are
    ongoing. Such changes CANNOT be applied.
