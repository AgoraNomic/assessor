[The line-item veto has been used approximately zero times, whereas the
requirement to select a new Comptrollor persists. The replacement text
is also considerably more compact.]

Repeal Rule 2597 (Line-item Veto).

Amend Rule 2451 (Executive Orders) by appending the following to the
list of Cabinet Orders:

  - Line Item Veto (Assessor): The Prime Minister clearly, directly,
    and without obfuscation identifies one or more individual
    changes in proposals whose decision's voting periods are
    ongoing. Such changes CANNOT be applied.
