Amend Rule 2680 to read, in whole:
{

Each of the following is a ritual act:
- Issuing a Cabinet Order.
- Assigning a judgement to a CFJ.
- Publishing the first report of a given Rules-defined type in an Agoran
week, provided such publishing fulfilled a Rules-defined duty to publish.
- For each person, eir becoming a candidate in an election for the first
time in an Agoran week.
- For each person, eir submitting a ballot on an Agoran decision for the
first time in an Agoran week.

When a ritual act is performed, any player CAN, within 7 days, by
announcement anoint a ritual number, specifying the ritual act and the
new ritual number. The anointed ritual number must be 0 or not more than
1 greater than the greatest previously anointed ritual number.

When a positive integral multiple of 41 is anointed as a ritual number
for the first time, the person who does so CAN, by announcement, Raise
the First Speaker in a powerful dance around the Town Fountain. Doing so
causes each player qualifying under this Rule to gain 1 radiance.

A player is qualifying under this Rule if and only if e is active, does
not have the highest radiance of any player, and is not tied for the
highest radiance among players.
