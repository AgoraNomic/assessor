[The intent here is the order folks fire rounds in a given week
shouldn't matter -- essentially everyone shoots simultaneously. That
way, there's no incentive to schedule things around midnight Monday.]

Amend rule 2692 (Bang!) by replacing "a single player is alive" with "a
single player was alive at the beginning of the week"

Amend rule 2696 (Bang actions) by replacing the paragraph reading:

       When a player (the shooter) fires a round, sequentially for each
       person (the target) in the target list, if the shooter is alive
       and has at least two bangs, and the target is an alive player,
       then two of the shooter's bangs are destroyed, after which the
       target is eliminated.

with:

       When a player (the shooter) fires a round, sequentially for each
       person (the target) in the target list, if the shooter has at
       least two bangs and was alive at the beginning of the week, and
       the target was an alive player at the beginning of the week, then
       two of the shooter's bangs are destroyed, after which the target
       is eliminated.
