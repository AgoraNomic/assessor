ID: 8882
Title: Referee referral reporting
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet

Amend Rule 2246 ("Submitting a CFJ to the Referee") by replacing the
second paragraph with the following:

{

When a CFJ is submitted to the Referee, the Referee receives all
obligations and powers, other than obligations to report, for that case
that the Arbitor would otherwise receive due to being Arbitor. This rule
takes precedence over Rules that would otherwise assign duties and
powers regarding to a judicial case to the Arbitor.

}


[Excludes reporting duties from being transferred to the Referee during
referral, which has caused some weirdness in the past (this also heavily
suggests that numbering should be done by the Arbitor, but that isn't
formalized). Also, cleans up the precedence language.]
