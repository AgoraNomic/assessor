Adoption index: 1.0

Enact a rule with power=1.0 entitled "Acting on commitment" with text:

{
A Fingerprint for a document (the Plaintext) is a document that could
not have been reasonably created without knowledge of the Plaintext, and
which is related to the Plaintext in such a way that one could not
reasonably produce another document related to that Fingerprint in the
same way.

Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
commitment" to a particular kind of document, that person performs
that action by performing it by announcement while, in the same
message, also publishing a what is purportedly a Fingerprint for a
document of that kind.
}
