Amend Rule 2657 (Scoring) by replacing the list item beginning "Casting"
with the following:

{

* Having a valid unconditional AGAINST vote on a referendum when it is
resolved to be ADOPTED, or, similarly, FOR when REJECTED: 1 (Assessor).

}


[Clarify that the referendum is resolved, rather than the proposal, that
the vote must be valid, and that the condition is evaluated at the time
of resolution.]
