Amend Rule 2438 ("Ribbons") by appending the following paragraph:

  Emerald (E): When a person wins an election, e earns an Emerald Ribbon.


[There's already a ribbon for deputisation, so why shouldn't there be
one for the other way to acquire an office? Also, this is an incentive
to initiate and become candidates in elections.]
