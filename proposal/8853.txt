Amend Rule 869 by appending the following paragraphs:
{
Banned is a secured negative boolean person switch tracked by the
Registrar. A person is unwelcome if e is Banned or if at least one part
of em is unwelcome. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an unwelcome
person CANNOT register or be registered, and e is immediately
deregistered if e is ever a player. Designations of unwelcomeness are
secured.

Unwelcomeness is to be used only to make a social statement that the
Agoran community no longer wishes to interact with certain persons; in
particular, it is not to be used to acquire gameplay advantage. As such,
an unwelcome person SHOULD NOT, under any circumstances, attempt to
bypass unwelcomeness, and e SHOULD carefully consider the circumstances
of eir becoming unwelcome before participating in public or discussion fora.
}
