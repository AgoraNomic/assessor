[Expedited proposals can be useful for bugfixes, counter-scams, or changes
we can unanimously agree are wanted quickly, so this is a proposal to
implement them safely.]

Amend Rule 2606 (Proposal Classes) to read in full:
{
      Proposals created since the enactment of this rule have a secured
      untracked Class switch with possible values ordinary (the default),
expedited, and democratic.

      When a proposal with an adoption index greater than or equal to
      3.0 is created, its class becomes democratic.

      Each player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip an ordinary proposal's
      class to democratic, provided it is in the Proposal Pool or
      that there is a referendum on it whose voting period has not yet
      ended.

      Each player CAN, with 2 support, flip an ordinary proposal's class to
expedited, provided it is in the Proposal Pool and e has not done so yet
this week. Each player CAN, by announcement, flip an expedited proposal's
class to ordinary, but SHOULD only do so if the proposal is not a bugfix,
emergency, or time-sensitive issue, or if e sees an issue with the proposal.

     Each player CAN distribute an expedited proposal, by announcement.
Each player CAN act on behalf of the Assessor to resolve an unresolved
referendum on an expedited proposal, provided that referendum has no valid
AGAINST ballots cast on it.
}

[Note that democratic (AI 3+) proposals can't be expedited.]
