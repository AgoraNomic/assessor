Title: Clean up distribution mechanisms
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: omd

Amend Rule 1607 (Distribution) by replacing;

  The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
  Pool at any time, by announcement.

with:

  The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
  Pool at any time.

[The "by announcement" is redundant with Rule 107's 'notice publication'
method, and IIRC there was a judgement that the two rules actually provide two
separate mechanisms for distributing proposals.]
