[Agora was given permission to hold stamps by P 9075, but was not reverted
when the raffle was repealed in P 9105. Since there's no economic benefit
to sending stamps to Agora, this is unnecessary complexity.]

Amend Rule 2659 ("Stamps") by replacing
{
   Stamps are a category of asset ownable by players and Agora.
}
with
{
   Stamps are a category of asset ownable by players.
}
