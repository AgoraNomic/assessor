Enact a new rule with the title "Oh we can write on it!" and power=2.1:
Any player, other than the owner of the Blank Stone,
CAN with 2 Agoran consent,
provide an escape chance (hereby C) and a single paragraph of scroll text
(hereby T).
Upon doing so, amend rule 2645 "The Stones" by
replacing the entire entry for Blank Stone with
"- Blank Stone (monthly,C%): T",
where C and T in this string are the provided escape chance, and scroll
text, respectively.
