     Any player who has not taken over the economy in the last 30
     days CAN pay a fee of N Winsomes to create 500 times N coins
     in eir possession, provided e does so unconditionally and
     without disclaimers, acting as emself, in a message body
     containing no other actions or other action attempts, and explicitly
     specifies N in the message (i.e. without indirect references such
     as "all").

     One week after this rule first takes effect, the winds die down.

     Immediately after Rule 2658 (The Winds Die Down) is repealed,
