Amend Rule 2125 by replacing "The Rules SHALL NOT be interpreted so as
to proscribe unregulated actions." with "The Rules are not to be
interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.".

[This doesn't need to be an actual crime.]


Amend Rule 2125 by appending the following paragraph:

{

The above notwithstanding, sending a message (in general or with
specific attributes) is never a regulated action; however, the rules may
be interpreted so as to proscribe sending public messages (in general or
with specific attributes).

}

[Clarify this (sending a message being regulated would be very bad) and
allow prohibiting the sending of messages (e.g. for No Faking).]
