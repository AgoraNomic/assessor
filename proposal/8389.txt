Amend Rule 2531 by deleting:
  If the Referee attempts to levy three or more INEFFECTIVE fines
  in a week, any player CAN, with two support, issue a writ of
  Impartial Arbitration Restoration, immediately making the
  position of Referee vacant. When a writ of Impartial Arbitration
  Restoration is issued, the ADoP SHALL initiate an election for
  the Referee in a timely fashion.

[context:  When this was written, there were very few protections in this
rule, and general impeachment didn't exist.  Now with the full list of
protections the Referee is pretty constrained, and impeachment exists.]
