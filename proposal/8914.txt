[I shouldn't have to do someone else's work for em to win.]

Amend R2656 by replacing:

       Upon a correct announcement from a player that e has a score of
       100 or more points, e wins the game.

with:

A player with 100 or more points CAN declare a High Score by
announcement and specifying exactly how many points e has. If a
player incorrectly does so, e loses 5 points. Upon a correct
declaration of High Score, that player wins the game.
