[No numerical switch uses the "default to 0" fallback, except for
Crystal's identity, which is always set to a different value before it
can be used. Considering the "default to null" fallback, 5 switches
explicitly create and define a "none" instance, and two more define
similar values under different names ("unassigned" and "vacant"). It is
clear then that neither of these fallbacks take on the semantic meaning
of "a default value meant to be used".

In this case, it would make more sense to unambiguously allow Crystal
identity to default to "null", assigning that fallback the semantic
meaning of "This switch must have a default value, but it does not
matter what it is because it is never used in practice."

Janet noted that this would break mathematical operations if a numerical
switch ends up using the default, but under this new semantic meaning I
believe the outcome is what is expected: since "null + 3" is undefined,
the switch fails to be flipped, and remains "null". (Defaulting to 0, on
the other hand, would give the guise that the default should be
considered a usable instance.)]

Amend Rule 2509 ("Agoran Numbers") by removing the following paragraph:
{
     If 0 is in the specified values for a numerical switch and no
default value is otherwise specified, 0 is the default value for that
switch.
}
