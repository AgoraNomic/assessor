Title: Tournament Conclusion Fixes v2
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: G., Oerjan


Amend Rule 2464, Tournaments, by replacing:

{

  If a winner of a tournament is determined within within 3 months of its
  initiation, that person or persons win the game, otherwise the
  tournament concludes with no winner.

}

with:

{

  Each time that one or more winners of a tournament are determined before
  it concludes, that person or those persons win the game. A tournament
  concludes when its regulations state that it concludes. Additionally, if
  it has not previously concluded, a tournament concludes 3 months after its
  initiation.

}


All ongoing tournaments hereby conclude with no (further) winner, except
for the tournament initiated on or about 2 July 2021 (if it is still
ongoing).


[Ensures that any previous ongoing tournaments that found a winner are
concluded (which the rule did not explicitly state).]
