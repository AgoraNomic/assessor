Amend Rule 2499 ("Welcome Packages") to read, in whole:

{

When a player receives a welcome package, if e has not received a
welcome package, including under any previous definition, since e last
registered nor in the last 30 days, e gains the following assets:

* One stamp of eir own type.

A player CAN, by announcement, cause a specified player to receive a
welcome package (syn. "grant" em a welcome package).

}


[Clarify the issues identified with welcome packages previously. There
has been discussion of adding pro-rated spendies, but that will be done
separately. Only a formatting change from V1.]
