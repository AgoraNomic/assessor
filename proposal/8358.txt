Title: No zombie blot creation v2
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Alexis


Amend Rule 2532 (Zombies) by inserting the following list item before
the item that says "deregister.":

    - create blots;

Expunge each blot that a zombie's master caused that zombie to create.

[First attempt was ineffective due to typo in "self-punishment"
proposal. Masters should not be able to hurt their zombies in this way.]
