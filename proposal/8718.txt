If a proposal entitled "No, we really mean it" has taken effect in the
past 30 days, this proposal has no further effect.

Amend Rule 1728 (Tabled Actions) by replacing the paragraph beginning "A
person CAN act" with the following

{

A person, acting as emself, CAN by announcement table an intent (syn.
"intend") to perform a tabled action, clearly, conspicuously,
explicitly, and without obfuscation specifying the action, the method
(including non-default parameter values), and, optionally, conditions.

}


[Resubmission of P8707 without the "highest possible communication
standard" clause.]
