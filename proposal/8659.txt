[Reword welcome packages to unambiguously make "grant" work and also add
a keyword for "cashing in" sets, to fix some clunky language.]

Amend R2577 "Asset Actions" by replacing:

  To grant an entity an asset is to create it in eir possession.

with:

  To grant an entity an asset is to create it in eir possession. To
  grant an entity a set of assets is to create each asset in the set
  in eir possession.

Amend R2499 "Welcome Packages" to read in full:

  A Welcome Package is a set of assets containing:

     * 10 boatloads of coins, AND
     * 1 of each type of card defined in the rules.

  Any player CAN grant a Welcome Package to any player if the grantee
  has neither received one since e last registered nor in the last 30
  days.

Ratify that all current players have received a Welcome Package since
they last registered.

Amend R2620 "Cards & Sets" by replacing:

  A player CAN pay a 'set' of X Cards of the same type

with:

  A player CAN pay a 'set' of (syn: "cash in") X Cards of the same
  type
