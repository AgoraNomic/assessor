Title: Proposal order clarification
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 106 by replacing the sentence "When a proposal takes effect,
the proposal applies the changes that it specifies, except as prohibited
by other rules." with the following:

{

When a proposal takes effect, the proposal applies the changes that it
specifies in its text, except as prohibited by other rules. Unless
otherwise specified by the text, the effects are applied in the order
they appear in the text.

}


[Clarify that the only place that proposal effects can be "specified" is
in the text and explicitly state that the effects are applied in listed
order.]
