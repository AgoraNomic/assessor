Amend Rule 2645 (The Stones) by replacing the definition of the
Recursion Stone with:

       - Recursion Stone (Monthly, 4): The Recursion Stone can be wielded
         once per month as if it had the power of any other stone of your
         choice (the Blueprint Stone), with any references to the
         Blueprint Stone itself changed to the Recursion Stone unless
         they specify otherwise.
