Enact a new Rule entitled "Land Tax" at power 1 with the following text:

{

At the beginning of each month, the following occur in order:

* Each player's Pyrite balance is reduced to one half of its current
value (rounded down).

* The Hectare balance of each player with more than 16 Hectares balance
is reduced to 16 + (X - 16)*3/4 (rounded down), where X is eir current
Hectare balance.

}

[Add something to counteract the otherwise-unchecked exponential growth.
This is written to occur automatically at the beginning of each month to
prevent timing scams.]
