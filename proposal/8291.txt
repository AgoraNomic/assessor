Title: Interesting Chambers v3.1
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Bernie
Co-authors: Trigon, Aspen, Gaelan, G., Janet, twg


[Enact a new Rule of Power 2.0, entitled "Ministries", with the following
text:

  A Ministry is an entity defined as such by this rule. Each
  Ministry has a goal. The Ministries of Agora, and their goals, are
  as follows:

   A. Ministry of Justice: serve justice to rulebreakers
   B. Ministry of Efficiency: see official duties performed swiftly
   C. Ministry of Legislation: see votes cast on proposals
   D. Ministry of Participation: reward players for achievements
   E. Ministry of Economy: encourage economic activity and contracts

  Interest is an office switch, tracked by the ADoP, whose possible
  values are lists of ministries, defaulting to the empty list. The
  ADoP CAN flip an office's interest without objection.

  For each item of each office's interest, that office's holder's
  voting strength is increased by 2 on proposals whose chamber is
  set to that ministry.


Enact a new Rule of Power 2.0, entitled "Proposal Classes", with the
following text:

  Proposals created since the enactment of this rule have an
  untracked Class switch with possible values ordinary (the default)
  and democratic.

  When a proposal with an adoption index greater than 2.0 is
  created, its class becomes democratic.

  Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip an ordinary proposal's
  class to democratic, provided that it is in the Proposal Pool or
  that there is an Agoran decision on its adoption whose voting
  period has not yet ended.


Enact a new Rule of Power 2.0, entitled "Proposal Chambers", with the
following text:

  Chamber is an untracked ordinary proposal switch whose possible
  values include unset (the default) and each of the ministries of
  Agora.

  A proposal's chamber SHOULD only be decided by which ministry's
  goals it effects to the greatest degree.

  Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip the chamber of an
  ordinary proposal to any ministry, provided that it is in the
  Proposal Pool or that there is an Agoran decision on its adoption
  whose voting period has not yet ended.


Amend Rule 1607, "Distribution", by changing "the text, author, and
coauthors of the proposal" to "the text, author, coauthors, class and
(if applicable) chamber of the proposal".


Amend Rule 2350, "Proposals", by adding the following to the list:

  * A chamber to which the proposal shall be assigned upon its
    creation.


Amend Rule 2422, "Voting Strength", by changing "between 0 and 5" to
"between 0 and 15".


// Move the PM's casting vote to the Speaker, since the PM already gets
// all ministries:

Amend Rule 2423, "First Among Equals", by removing the second paragraph.

Amend Rule 103, "The Speaker", by changing "For an election of the Prime
Minister, the Speaker" to "The Speaker".


Set the ADoP's Interest to [Efficiency].
Set the Arbitor's Interest to [Justice].
Set the Assessor's Interest to [Efficiency, Legislation].
Set the Herald's Interest to [Participation].
Set the Prime Minister's Interest to [Justice, Efficiency, Legislation,
  Participation, Economy].
Set the Promotor's Interest to [Legislation].
Set the Referee's Interest to [Justice].
Set the Registrar's Interest to [Efficiency].
Set the Rulekeepor's Interest to [Legislation, Participation].
Set the Tailor's Interest to [Participation].
Set the Treasuror's Interest to [Economy, Economy].

// Some of the above have been slightly rejigged given the new
// definition of Participation

/* Treasuror is given Economy twice for balance reasons:
 *  - It is a high-complexity office (was given Complexity=3 under
 *    Politics), like Assessor and Rulekeepor; this makes the power
 *    commensurate to the importance, and there is no ministry it really
 *    fits under besides Economy
 *  - It bumps up the number of voting increases issued for Economy
 *    proposals; all other ministries have 2-3 excluding the PM.
 * Not just trying to give myself votes, I swear :P
