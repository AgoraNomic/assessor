Amend Rule 107 by:

* Replacing "The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
period for the decision." with "The initiation of an Agoran decision
also initiates the voting period for that decision.".

* Replacing the text ", and that such a decision was initiated" with the
text ", that such a decision was initiated, and that that decision's
voting period was initiated".


[Per ais523's judgement in CFJ 4118. We don't need to state the
requirement to "publish[] a valid notice" twice for initiating Agoran
decisions, and we should always ratify that the voting period was
initiated anyway.]
