[This helps for any proposals that either were distributed before the new
regime and failed quorum, or any proposals that are accidentally distributed
and failed quorum. While I'm at it, there's no reason this needs to be at
power 3.0.]

Amend Rule 2350, "Proposals", by deleting the text:
  If a decision of whether to adopt a proposal was resolved as
  FAILED QUORUM in the last seven days, the Promotor CAN once add
  the proposal back to the Proposal Pool by announcement.

Enact a new rule entitled "Proposal Recycling", with the following text:

  If a decision of whether to adopt a proposal was resolved as
  FAILED QUORUM in the last seven days, the Promotor CAN once recycle
  the proposal by announcement, adding it to the Proposal Pool and causing
  it to become pended.
