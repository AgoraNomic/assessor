Amend Rule 1681 ("The Logical Rulesets") by replacing the paragraph
containing "the rule's revision number" with the following paragraph:

{

The listing of each rule in the SLR must additionally include a revision
number selected by the Rulekeepor. The Rulekeepor SHOULD select revision
numbers such that they can be used retrospectively to determine that the
text of a rule has changed while it maintained the same ID number. The
Rulekeepor may exercise reasonable discretion in calculating revision
numbers.

}
