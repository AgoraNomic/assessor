Title: If there exists a party
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet

Amend Rule 2480 ("Festivals") by replacing the final two paragraphs with
the following paragraphs:

{

A Festive person is a person whose Laudability is greater than or equal
to Agora's Festivity. An N-Festive person is a person who would be
Festive, were Agora's Festivity N.

For any integer N greater than Agora's Festivity, an N-Festive player
CAN flip Agora's Festivity to N with 4 support from other N-Festive
players, unless Agora's Festivity has had a value greater than or equal
to N in the past 21 days.

}

[Adds onto the first proposal ("Did you get a permit for that party?")
by rewriting the same text in slightly more mathematical language. We
think this is clearer than the original rule, but opinions may vary. The
two proposals are written such that this should work even if the first
one doesn't pass.]
