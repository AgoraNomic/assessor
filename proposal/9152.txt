[Creates a stone that's effectively worth -1 in the count.]

Amend rule 2645 (The Stones) by adding, at the end, to the list of stones:

       - Tacky Stone (monthly): Wielding the Tacky Stone reminds
         everyone how much of an eyesore it is. If the Tacky Stone is
         not immune, any player CAN pay a fee of X Spendies to transfer
         the Tacky Stone to a specified entity that the rules permit to
         own stones, where X is the current Stone Cost of the Tacky
         Stone. When this occurs, the stone cost of the Tacky Stone is
         set to its default value.

Amend rule 2644 (Zen Gardening) by replacing "that owns 8 or more
stones" with "with an impressive rock collection" and inserting as the
first paragraph of the rule the following text (including an embedded list):

       A player has an impressive rock collection if e:
         1) owns 10 or more stones; or
         2) owns 8 or more stones and does not own the Tacky Stone.
