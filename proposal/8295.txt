Title: Rewards Reform Act
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Bernie
Co-authors: Kate, Alexis


/* 1. Changes rewards to be issued by relevant officers (mostly ADoP,
   *    Arbitor) in their weekly reports, instead of calculated and
   *    claimed by individual players themselves.
   * 2. Effectively converts Glitter into a reward issued by the Tailor.
   *    (Players must still claim their Glitter by announcement, but the
   *    Tailor calculates the coin amounts and awards them all in
   *    weekly batches.)
   * 3. Makes all Ribbons (except White, Gray, Black) eligible for
   *    Glitter.
   */

Amend Rule 2496 ("Rewards") as follows:

  Replace its first two paragraphs with the following:

    Each time a player fulfills a reward condition, the officer
    associated with the condition CAN once, and SHALL before the end
    of the next Agoran week, grant the associated set of assets to the
    player.

    Below is a list of reward conditions and their associated assets
    and officers.

  Append "(Assessor)" to the first list item.

  Append "(Arbitor)" to the second list item.

  Append "(ADoP)" to the third list item.

  Append "(ADoP)" to the fourth list item.

  Append "(Herald)" to the fifth list item.


Amend Rule 2438 ("Ribbons") as follows:

  Replace the paragraph starting "While a person qualifies..." with
  the following:

    A person qualifies for a type of Ribbon if e has earned that type
    of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days (including earlier in the
    same message).

  [Removed the Gray and Transparent rephrasings as they were
   unnecessarily confusing and had minimal effect.]

  Move the list item starting "Emerald" so that it falls between the
  list items starting "Green" and "Cyan". [This was bothering me.]

  Append the following:

    While a person qualifies for a type of Ribbon:

      - If e has not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7
        days, any player CAN, by announcement, award em that type of
        Ribbon.

      - Otherwise, if e has not been awarded that type of Ribbon or
        the corresponding type of Glitter since e last earned or
        came to qualify for that type of Ribbon, e CAN, by
        announcement, award emself that type of Glitter.

Amend Rule 2602 ("Glitter") to read:

  For each type of Ribbon, there is a type of Glitter with the same
  name. An attempt to award Glitter is INEFFECTIVE if the type of
  Glitter is not specified.

  Each time a player is awarded a type of Glitter, the Tailor CAN
  once, and SHALL before the end of the next Agoran week, grant the
  player N+1 coins, where N is the number of players who did not
  own the corresponding type of Ribbon at the time of the award.

  [If the mechanics of the change are approved, R2602 could later be
   further simplified by merging the first para into 2438 and the
   second into R2496]
