Title: Authorized initiation
Adoption index: 3.0

Amend Rule 107 ("Initiating Agoran Decisions") by replacing "A public
notice purporting to initiate an Agoran decision is a self-ratifying
attestation of the notice's validity." with "A public notice purporting
to initiate an Agoran decision is a self-ratifying attestation that the
notice was valid, that the person (if any) publishing the notice was
authorized to initiate the decision, and that such a decision was
initiated.".

[The notice being "valid" is not enough for the decision to have been
initiated, so also ratify that there was authorization and that the
decision was actually initiated. Luckily this shouldn't matter
historically because Rule 2034 ensures that the decision is ratified
into existence at resolution.]
