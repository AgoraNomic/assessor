[Right now, sentences like "Blank are an asset ownable by..." is
interpreted to adding to a default within R2576. This seems unintuitive.
This proposal makes that default only apply if there's no mention of
ownership.]

Retitle R2578 (Currencies) to "Fungibility"

Amend R2578 to read in full:

    A fungible asset is one where two instances of it are considered
    equivalent if they have the same owner, for the purposes of
    specification, granting, and transferring. The total amount of a
    fungible asset that an entity owns is also know as that entities
    "balance" of that asset.

Amend R2659 (Stamps) by replacing:

    Stamps of a given type are a currency.

with:

    Stamps of a given type are fungible.

Amend R2555 (Blots) by replacing:

    Blots are an indestructible fixed currency

with:

    Blots are an indestructible fixed fungible asset
