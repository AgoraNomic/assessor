Amend Rule 2124 (Performing Tabled Actions) by replacing this text:

       An intent is ripe if was tabled within the past 14 days, the
       Speaker hasn't objected to it in the past 48 hours, and its
       conditions, if any, are each clearly and unambiguously met.

with this text:

       An intent is ripe if was tabled within the past 14 days, the
       Speaker hasn't objected to it in the past 48 hours, its
       conditions (if any) are each clearly and unambiguously met,
       and no one has already acted as allowed based on that intent.

[Prevent reusing intents even if they're less than two weeks old. If
  we spot a use case where we agree they should be reusable, then we
  can define an exception mechanism.]
