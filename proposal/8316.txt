Amend Rule 683 (Voting on Agoran Decisions) by appending the following
paragraph:
{{
  The above notwithstanding, at the end of the voting period for an Agoran
  decision, prior to the evaluation of conditionals, each entity who has
  never submitted a valid ballot for that decision, and for whom the Rules
  provide a default vote for that decision, automatically submits a valid
  vote on that decision for eir default vote and becomes quorum-ineligible
  for that decision. Providing an entity with a default vote on an Agoran
  decision is secured with power threshold 2.
}}

[We do not think that the "never submitted" condition is too onerous on the
Assessor as e will be going through all the votes anyway.

We would even go with "never attempted to", but we suspect that might lead
to too much litigation, particularly because the easiest way to try and
fail is a NttPF.]

Amend Rule 955 (Determining the Will of Agora) by inserting: {
  Designating a voter as quorum-ineligible on an Agoran decision is secured
  with Power Threshold 2; all voters are otherwise quorum-eligible.
}
and by replacing: {
  If there is more than one option, and the number of voters is less than the
  quorum of that decision, the outcome is instead FAILED QUORUM.
} with {
  If there is more than one option on an Agoran decision, and the number of
  quorum-eligible voters on it is less than its quorum, its outcome is
  instead FAILED QUORUM.
}

[Cleaned up this language because there's already a definition of a voter
applicable to R955 here in R208 (possibly moved as a result of my other
proposal). While I don't think Gaelan's suggestion of clearing up the
possibility of a ballot identical to a default ballot was necessary, this
is cleaner IMO.]

Amend Rule 879 (Quorum) by replacing {
  If no other rule defines the quorum of an Agoran Decision, the quorum for
  that decision is equal to 2/3 of the number of voters on the Agoran
  Decision to adopt a proposal that had been most recently resolved at the
  time of that decision's initiation, the whole rounded to the nearest
  integer (breaking ties upward).
} with {
  The Activity Level is equal to 2/3, rounded to the nearest integer and
  breaking ties upward, of the number of quorum-eligible voters on the most
  recently-resolved Agoran decision to adopt a proposal. If no other rules
  define the quorum of an Agoran decision, then the quorum of that decision
  is equal to the Activity Level at the time if its initiation.
}

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Zombie Voting" reading as follows:
{{
  A zombie has its voting strength halved.

  The default vote of a zombie is to endorse eir master.

  Zombies are not quorum-eligible for any Agoran decision.
}}
[Rounding is already provided by R2422.]
