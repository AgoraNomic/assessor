[Currently, Sets would make me track proposals forever. The simplest
fix is just to make the Pended switch untracked. It'll end up getting
effectively tracked anyway, since it determines whether a proposal must
be distributed.]

Amend the rule entitled "Pending Proposals" by changing the text "Pended is a
negative boolean proposal switch tracked by the Promotor." to read
"Pended is an untracked negative boolean proposal switch."
