Title: Offices are complex v2
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Trigon
Co-authors: ATMunn


Enact a new power-1 rule entitled "Complexity" with the text:

  Complexity is an office switch reflecting how complex it is to
  fulfill the duties of its office. Its possible values are all
  integers from 0 to 3 inclusive, where 1 is the default. It is
  tracked in the ADoP's weekly report. The ADoP CAN, with 2 Agoran
  consent, flip the complexity of an office.

Set the complexity switch of the following offices as such:

ADoP:           1
Arbitor:        2 [comment: if we split CotC this should go down]
Assessor:       3
Coopor:         1
Distributor:    0
Herald:         2
Notary:         2
Prime Minister: 0
Promotor:       3
Referee:        2
Registrar:      1
Rulekeepor:     3
Speaker:        0
Tailor:         1
Treasuror:      3
Webmastor:      1

Amend Rule 2496 "Rewards" by replacing the text "5 coins" in the
following bullet points as such:

  - the bullet point beginning "Publishing an office's weekly or monthly
    report": 5 coins times the complexity of the office
  - the bullet point beginning "Resolving a referendum": 5 coins times
    the Assessor's complexity.
  - the bullet point beginning "Initiating a referendum", if it exists: 5
    coins times the Promotor's complexity.
