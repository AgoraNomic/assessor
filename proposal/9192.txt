[At various times, folks have mentioned that crystals have influenced
how they voted on proposals. Since they've been around a while, I
figured it was worth talking everyone's temperature on them. In order to
make sure crystals don't get repealed on a narrow result, I deliberately
set the AI a little higher than it strictly needs to be. Also, at this
point, I expect to be voting PRESENT personally.]
