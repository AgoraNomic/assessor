In Rule 2492 (Recusal),

s/deregistered/unregistered

[Allows a judge to be removed if, through some mishap, the CFJ has
 been assigned to someone who has never been a player or who ceased to
 be a player through some means other than deregistration. Composition
 fully intended to annoy Janet, but I think completely effective under
 the new standard of "clear to a reasonable player".]
