Amend Rule 2451 ("Executive Orders") by deleting the list item
(including the bullet point) that contains "Growth". Amend Rule 2645
("The Stones") by, as a single amendment:

* Deleting the list item (including the bullet point) that contains
"Anti-Equatorial Stone", the list item (including the bullet point) that
contains "Loud Stone", and the list item (including the bullet point)
that contains "Protection Stone".

* Replacing each instance of the text "non-immune stone" with "stone".

* In the list item containing "Hot Potato Stone", deleting from " If
this stone is not owned by Agora" (inclusive) to the end of the list item.

[Growth and the Anti-Equatorial Stone depend on mossiness, which no
longer exists. The Loud Stone depends on Dreams, which no longer exist.
The Protection Stone depends on immunity, which no longer Next, Also,
clean up references to immunity. Finally, the Hot Potato Stone no longer
needs to restrict transference, as stones are now fixed.]
