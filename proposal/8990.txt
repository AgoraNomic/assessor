Amend Rule 2645 by (as a single amendment) replacing "the Soul Stone is
transferred" with "this stone is transferred",  by replacing: "The
Recursion Stone can be wielded" with "This stone can be wielded", and by
replacing "the Anti-Equatorial Stone's mossiness" with "the wielded
stone's mossiness".

[Ensure that these stones don't break when used with the Recursion Stone.]
