Title: Specified Crime not Rule
Adoption index: 1.7

Amend Rule 2478, "Vigilante Justice" by replacing the first paragraph
with the following:
  A player CAN by announcement Point eir Finger at a player (the
  perp); the announcement is INEFFECTIVE if it does not explicitly
  name the perp, cite a specific rule or named crime, and specify an
  alleged violation of that rule or commission of that crime by that
  person.

[ This will allow someone to use the name of a crime without specifying
which rule defines it. This also addresses some concerns raised by nix
regarding unnecessary or archaic provisions.]
