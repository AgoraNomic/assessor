Amend the rule with title "Motivating Horses" by replacing "When the race
begins anew" with "When the race starts anew".

[To match with all the other instances.]

Set the horses' pulls to the following:

HORSE           PULLS
------------------------
Alexia          Nacho
Baxter          Fargo
Cannon          Alexia
Destructor      Baxter
Fargo           Alexia, Destructor
Nacho           Baxter, Cannon
Rubert          Alexia, Cannon
Sugar           Baxter, Destructor


[These pulls should be set immediately, but won't be set when the rule is
enacted because the race won't begin anew when that happens.]
