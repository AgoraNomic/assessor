Amend Rule 2695 (The Veblen) by adding this paragraph after the
paragraph beginning "A player CAN pay a fee of X spendies,":

       If the Veblen has not been transferred or devalued within the past
       month, then a player CAN devalue the Veblen by announcement, thus
       setting the Veblen cost to half its current value (rounded up).

[It's been over two months since anyone bought the Veblen. While
  multi-player coalitions are a fine theory, there is no particular
  evidence that the current rule will inspire them to act.]
