WHEREAS an elementary aspect of legal traditions that we all share is that
no criminal defendant should bear the burden of proof, and that the Agoran
system of criminal justice fails in other basic respects the people of
Agora HEREBY RESOLVE the following
  Retitle rule 2531 to "Defendant's Rights"
  Retitle rule 2479 to "Official Injustice"
  Amend the following text in rule 2531 "(1) it attempts to levy a fine on a
  person for an action or inaction which e (more likely than not) did not
  commit" to state "(1) it attempts to levy a fine on a person when that
  person can't be established by a preponderance of the evidence to have
  committed the action or inaction for which the fine was levied"
