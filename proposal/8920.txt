Amend Rule 2486 ("The Royal Parade") by replacing "Jason" with "Janet".

[P8904: typoed rule number.]


If Rule 2643 ("Collecting Stones") does not contain the text "A stone is
immune if and only if", amend it by prepending the following paragraphs:

{

A stone is immune if and only if it is defined as such by the rules of
power not less than 2.

A stone is immune if it is owned by Agora. A stone is immune if it has
been granted immunity since the last collection notice. The granting of
immunity is secured.

}

[P8906: potential "paragraph"/"paragraphs" ambiguity.]


Amend Rule 2643  ("Collecting Stones") by replacing the final paragraph
with the following:

{

When a Collection Notice is published, for each player, half (rounded
up) of eir non-immune stones with slipperiness not less than the Escape
Minimum are transferred to Agora, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
A Collection Notice includes selections of which eligible stones escape
(which shall prevail in determining which stones are transferred). The
mossiness of each stone that is not transferred is incremented by 1.

}

[P9807: merge conflict.]


Decrease the score of the author of this proposal by 5 points.

[These were all my mistakes; I don't deserve points for fixing them.]
