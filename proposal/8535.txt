  Any entity that is or ever was an organism generally capable of
  freely originating and communicating independent thoughts and
  ideas is a person. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no other
  entities are persons.

with:

  Any entity (including a group of confederated entities) that is or
  ever was able to willingly communicate original ideas is a person.
  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are persons.

  Questions about personhood are to be resolved equitably,
  with regard for the good-faith of those involved and the customs of
  honorable play.

  An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
  prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
  indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
  intends to become a player at that time.

inserting the new text:

  No person can be a player if e is part of another player or
  another player is part of em.

and inserting a paragraph break immediately thereafter.

  When a player receives a Welcome Package, if e has not received
  one in the past 30 days, then e gains 10 boatloads of coins and
  one of each type of Card defined in the rules.

with:

  When a player receives a Welcome Package, e gains 10 boatloads of coins and
  one of each type of Card defined in the rules, unless e, or any person
  of whom e was a part or who was a part of em has received a welcome
  package in the last 30 days.
