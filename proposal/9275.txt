Amend Rule 2518 ("Determinacy") by replacing the text "If a value CANNOT
be reasonably determined" with the text "If a value cannot be reasonably
determined".

[We almost certainly mean "cannot" here in the natural language sense:
determining something (in this sense) is not a regulated action; it
requires thought and potentially a judicial process.]
