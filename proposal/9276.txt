If exactly one rule contains the text
{{{
Whenever a player scores a number as described in this rule, the
Numerator CAN once, and SHALL in a timely manner, grant its author
}}}
then amend that rule by replacing that text with
{{{
Whenever a player scores a number as described in this rule, the
Numerator CAN once, and SHALL in a timely manner, grant that player
}}}
[This is a fix-forward for text in a rule proposed in a proposal that
has not yet been adopted, written so as to not care about what number
the rule eventually ends up being given.]
