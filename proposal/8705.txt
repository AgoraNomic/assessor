[This should rectify the double-halving of points. The values equal *half*
(rounded up) of the points lost to the *first* halving, which is
appropriate instead of the full value because of the halving that will
happen at the end of the quarter, before this would pass. I also subtracted
5 from the value I would receive to negate the points from this proposal
passing.]
