Title: Reasonably Responsive Reactivation
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: Trigon


Amend Rule 2646 (Activity) by replacing "A player CAN activate or
deactivate emself by announcement." with "A player CAN activate emself
by publishing a message that indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably
unambiguously that e intends to become active. A player CAN deactivate
emself by announcement.".

[People who are reactivating themselves are unlikely to know the exact
phrasing that is necessary to do so. This makes it easier by bringing
the standard for reactivation in line with the standard for registration.]
