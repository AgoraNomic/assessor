Title: Festival intent eligibility
Adoption index: 3.0

Amend Rule 2481 (Festival Restrictions) by appending the following item
to the sole list:

{

  5. Non-Festive players are not eligible to object to intents to perform
  the following actions:

      a. Enact, amend, or repeal Emergency Regulations

      b. Impeach officers

}


[These are potentially things that we may want to do during an invasion,
and the invaders should not be able to interfere with them. A broad
objection ban doesn't make sense like it does for support, since we
don't want scammers to be able to RWO using festivals.]
