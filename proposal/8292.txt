   * same numbering scheme (always a headache).
   * This also clarifies that non-players are able to issue CoEs - this
   * was already possible (and may be useful as a protection against
   * accidental deregistrations from incorrect Registrar reports) but
   * was a bit non-obvious.

  error), identifying a document and explaining the scope and nature
  of a perceived error in it (or in a statement it attests to).

  (if e was required to publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise)
  do one of the following in a timely fashion, in an announcement
  that clearly cites the claim of error:
