Amend the Rule entitled "The Veblen" to read, in whole:

{

The Veblen is a unique indestructible fixed asset tracked by the
Abusrdor, with ownership entirely restricted to players and Agora. If
the Veblen would otherwise be in abeyance, or if it is owned by the Lost
and Found Department, it is immediately transferred to Agora.

The Veblen cost is a secured singleton positive integer switch tracked
by the Absurdor and with default value one.

A player who does not own the Veblen CAN pay a fee of X spendies to
purchase the Veblen, where X is an integer not less than the current
Veblen cost. When e does so, the Veblen is transferred to em, then the
Veblen cost is set to X+1.

The owner of the Veblen SHOULD conspicuously show off eir ownership of
it from time to time.

}


The Veblen is hereby transferred to the entity that owned the Veblen
immediately before this proposal began taking effect (if e does not
already own it).

The Veblen cost is hereby flipped to what the Veblen Cost was
immediately before this proposal began taking effect (if it does not
already have that value).

[Normalize tracking language. Normalize transfer language. Fix
"ownership of the Veblen", if such a thing exists. Prohibit
self-purchases.]
