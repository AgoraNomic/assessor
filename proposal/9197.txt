[Maybe this could be a way to spur some more gameplay.

The underlying idea:
Spendies -> candles (contest subgames) -> radiance

Players can still buy radiance directly, they still get a universal
basic income in spendies, etc.

Candles are a shelf-stable form of radiance but can only be held by
contests. 1 spendie grants 1 candle; 1 candle grants 1 radiance.

Under this model, Bang! could be reconstituted as a contest if folks
wished.]


Create a rule entitled "Contests" with power 1.5 reading:

       Contestation is a secured negative boolean contract switch
       tracked by the Notary. A contract whose contestation switch is
       true is a contest.

       A player CAN flip a specified contract's contestation to true
       without 2 objections.

       A player CAN flip a specified contract's contestation to false
       with Agoran consent.


Create a rule entitled "Candles" with power 1.5 reading:

       Candles are fixed fungible assets tracked by the Illuminator.

       Contests are the only entities permitted to own candles, and any
       candles held by any other entity are immediately destroyed.

       A player CAN pay a fee of 1 spendie to grant 1 candle to a
       contest.

       As explicitly and unambiguously permitted by a contest's body, a
       party to that contest CAN bestow a prize by an announcement
       clearly identifying the recipient player, the amount of radiance
       to award (N), and the relevant contest. Upon doing so, if the
       specified contest possesses at least N candles the following
       happen in order: N of its candles are destroyed, then the
       specified player gains N radiance.
