Amend rule 2143, "Official Reports and Duties", by removing
the paragraph starting "A person SHALL NOT publish information
that is inaccurate or misleading".

[This clause is duplicated by No Faking, except that it also
illegalises _accidentally_ publishing an inaccurate report,
or deliberately and obviously publishing an inaccurate report
for the public good, both of which I think ought to be
allowed.]
