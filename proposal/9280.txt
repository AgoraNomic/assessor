Amend Rule 2162 (Switches) by replacing this text:

       If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
       value, it comes to have its default value.

with this text:

       If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
       value, and no other method defined by this rule or its backing
       document would assign it a possible value, then it comes to have
       its default value.

and by inserting this paragraph after the
paragraph starting with "A boolean switch":

       A rounded switch is a switch defined as such by its backing
       document. Each type of rounded switch has a granularity (a real
       number, equal to 1 unless otherwise specified by its backing
       document). If an instance of a rounded switch would otherwise
       have a real but impossible value (V), then it comes to have a
       value of the multiple of its granularity closest to V (breaking
       ties toward zero, unless its backing document says otherwise).
