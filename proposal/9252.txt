To rule 1367 "Degrees", add a paragraph before the one beginning
"Degrees SHOULD be awarded" which reads:

===
The Herald is ENCOURAGED to enact administrative regulations including
specific guidelines on how to submit theses, a detailed description of
the peer-review process, and specific qualifications for degrees in
general and for specific degrees.
===

Comment: This comes from a discussion on Discord in which several
people, both established players and newer Agorans, expressed
discontentment with how requirements to submit a thesis for a degree are
communicated to players. Although Administrative Regulations have a
visibility problem, this is at least one way to help with that.
