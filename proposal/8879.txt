{

- Mason's Stone (Monthly, 0): If the Mason's Stone is owned by the
Stonemason, its Mossiness is continuously set to 0. If the Mason's Stone
is owned by Agora, it is transferred to the Stonemason. When wielded, a
specified stone owned by Agora that is not the single mossiest stone
owned by Agora is transferred to the wielder.
