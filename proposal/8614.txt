Title: Simultaneity Security
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason

Amend Rule 478 by, as a single amendment, inserting a paragraph break
before "Any action performed by sending a message", then appending to
the (new) final paragraph: "Allowing actions performed by sending a
message to take place simultaneously must be done explicitly and is
secured at power 2."

[This prohibits simultaneity without an authorizing rule, which is less
extreme than a total ban (which G. has exposed disapproval of).]
