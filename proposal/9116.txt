Enact the following rule with title "Bang!" and the following text:

{
Bangs are a fungible asset.

Vitality is an untracked player Switch with possible values of
Invulnerable, Alive, Unalive, or Ghostly (default). A player with a
Vitality that is not Ghostly is called “corporeal”, else e is called
"ghostly".

To "incarnate" is to flip one's Vitality to Invulnerable. A ghostly player
CAN
incarnate by announcement, provided there are only Invulnerable or Ghostly
players.

Each corporeal player SHOULD list eir Vitality and Bang Balance in all eir
messages.

Any player CAN publish a report of all Bang Balances and Vitalities. Such a
report SHOULD be made and Ratified Without Objection as needed.

Each Alive player CAN eliminate another specified Alive player by paying a
fee of 1 bang. Eliminating a player makes em Unalive, and then grants em 1
bang.

Any Alive player CAN Stand Alone by announcement, if there are no other
players that are Alive, and no person has won the game by doing so in the
past 7 days. When a player Stands Alone, e wins the game. If a player won
the game in this manner 4 days ago, then the match is reset.

When the match is reset, each player is set to Ghostly, all bangs are
destroyed, and then each player gains 1 bang.

When 7 days have passed since the match is reset, all Invulnerable
players have eir Vitality set to Alive.

When 14 days have passed since a player was last eliminated, the match
resets, and then each player that was alive immediately before the match
reset gains 1 bang.
}

The match is hereby reset.
