Amend Rule 1681, 'The Logical Rulesets', by appending
{
 The Readable Logical Ruleset (RLR) is a format of the ruleset. In
this format, rules do not have to be individually listed; if multiple
rules have similar concepts as The Simplifior sees fit, then they may
be listed in one paragraph as a Combined Rule.

Rules in the RLR are permitted to be restated approximately, provided
that they mean the same things.

When writing a Combined Rule, The Simplifior must record all rules
referenced in the paragraph immediately after the rule has been
referenced.

The Simplifior need not use the exact wording of the rule referenced
when writing a Combined Rule.

}

 Enact the following rule, with the title 'The Simplifior' and the
following text:

 {

 The Simplifior is an office; its holder is responsible for increasing
the readability of the Short Logical Ruleset by making a more readable
version.

The Simplifior SHOULD maintain the Readable Logical Ruleset when any
rules are amended, enacted, or removed.

The Simplifior's monthly report includes the Readable Logical Ruleset.
The Simplifior's report SHOULD prominently and clearly include a
reminder that the RLR is a summary and only the rules' full text
actually governs.

 }
