Create a rule titled "Crop Seasons" with this text:

       The Crop Season is determined by the current Agoran month:

         * Spring - March, July, November
         * Summer - April, August, December
         * Autumn - January, May, September
         * Winter - February, June, October

Create a rule titled "The Land Managor" with this text:

       The Land Managor is an office.

       The Land Manager's report includes a list of types of Crops and
       their attributes, and a list of Crops planted and harvested during
       the current Crop Season.

Create a rule titled "Pyrite" with this text:

       Pyrite is a type of fixed asset, tracked by the Land Managor.

       A player CAN pay a fee of 1 Spendie to gain 100 Pyrite.

       A player CAN pay a fee of 200 Pyrite to gain 1 Spendie.

Create a rule titled "Crops" with this text:

       Creating and destroying types of Crop is secured.

       Each type of Crop has an associated Crop Season, Seed Cost, Growth
       Duration, and Sell Price. Actions involving any of these
       attributes use the attribute values for the type of Crop involved
       in that action.

       An in-season Crop is one whose Crop Season is in progress. All
       others are out-of-season.

Create a rule titled "The Growth Cycle" with this text:

       A player CAN plant an in-season Crop by paying a fee in Pyrite
       equal to its Seed Cost.

       Once per Crop that a player planted earlier in the current Crop
       Season and at least <Growth Duration> days ago, e CAN harvest it
       by announcement, gaining Pyrite equal to its Sell Price.

       At the end of each Crop Season, all unharvested Crops are lost.

Create a rule titled "Genetic Modification" with this text:

       Once per Crop Season, a player CAN pay a fee of 500 Pyrite to
       create a new type of Crop, specifying its name. The Land Managor
       SHALL, in a timely fashion after this occurs, randomly select its
       Crop Season, Seed Cost (50 to 200), Growth Duration (3 to 24), and
       Sell Price (100 to 400). Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, it
       CANNOT be planted until e performs these selections.

       Once per Crop Season, a player CAN pay a fee of 750 Pyrite to
       alter a type of out-of-season Crop's Seed Cost, Growth Duration,
       or Sell Price by up to 25% in either direction, provided that they
       remain within the random ranges for new types of Crop.

       Once per Crop Season, a player CAN pay a fee of 1000 Pyrite to
       remove a type of out-of-season Crop.

Create the following types of Crop:

          * Pea         (CS Spring, SC 100, GD 14, SP 184)
          * Shallot     (CS Spring, SC  94, GD  9, SP 169)
          * Bell Pepper (CS Summer, SC 112, GD 12, SP 217)
          * Cabbage     (CS Summer, SC 146, GD 13, SP 273)
          * Chard       (CS Autumn, SC 200, GD 10, SP 349)
          * Spinach     (CS Autumn, SC 165, GD  7, SP 335)
