[It's terribly confusing for everyone to leave out a proposal title. Leaving
out AI only works if it's 1.0 anyway, and confuses me every time I see it.
I usually spend like a solid minute checking that I haven't missed something
as Promotor and that the proposal is effective at that power as a player.
Just making these fields mandatory would save everyone so much trouble and
be only marginally more work for authors.]

Amend Rule 2350, "Proposals", by changing the first paragraph, including
the following list, to read in full:

  A proposal is an entity consisting of a body of text and
  other attributes. A player CAN create a proposal by announcement,
  specifying its text, an associated title, and a valid adoption index, and
  optionally specifying a list of co-authors (who must be persons other
  than the author).
