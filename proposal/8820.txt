In Rule 2657 (Scoring), replace:

        * Having a valid unconditional AGAINST vote on a referendum when
          it is resolved to be ADOPTED, or, similarly, FOR when
          REJECTED: 1 (Assessor).

with:

        * Having a valid unconditional AGAINST vote on a referendum when
          it is resolved to be ADOPTED: 1 (Assessor). Similarly for FOR
          when REJECTED, but only if (a) it would have been ADOPTED if
          the total strength of all valid ballots cast FOR it had been
          twice as large, and (b) the player has not already gained five
          or more points this way since the start of the week.
