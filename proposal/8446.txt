If Proposal 8407 (no stinking auction definitions) has not taken
effect, the rest of this proposal has no effect.


Enact the following rule, Victory Auctions:

  The Treasuror CAN conduct an auction (a "victory auction") if no
  victory auction is ongoing.  The Treasuror MUST do so at least
  once a month, and SHOULD do so at least twice each month.

  A victory auction includes the following lots:

  * one new Victory Card.

  * all of any single type of card or product, currently owned by
    the Lost and Found Department, if any.

  The currency of a victory auction is coins (minimum bid 1).
