Amend Rule 2655 by replacing:
  responsible for building and maintaining the Device.
with:
  responsible for building, tracking, and maintaining the Device.

and by deleting:
  This intent announcement counts as the Mad Engineers's
  weekly report.

[with the reporting duty for the device status added, by default a weekly
switch value report, we no longer need this intent to count as a report to
get the weekly report reward.  The intent is still part of "weekly duties"
but not the report.]
