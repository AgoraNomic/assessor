Title: Prevent cheap Stone wins

In rule 2642, amend:
{{{
      Stone Cost is a Stone switch with values of non-negative integers
      and a default of 10.
}}}
to
{{{
      Stone Cost is a Stone switch with values of non-negative integers
      and a default of 20.
}}}

Then increase the Stone Cost of every Stone by 10.

[At present, Stones are sufficiently cheap that the defensive measures
necessary to prevent easy Stone wins by other players are too expensive
for players to take them in practice â€“ and the Stones system was
designed assuming that they would be harder to obtain than that.
Starting a descending-price auction from a price of 10 doesn't function
because Stones are frequently more valuable than that. Doubling the
starting cost should make the Stone gameplay work better.]
