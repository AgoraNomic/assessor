Title: Future-proofing black ribbons
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason

Amend Rule 2438 (Ribbons) by replacing the text "An Instrument CAN, as
part of its effect" with the text "A statute CAN, as part of its effect".


[Legislative intent is that black ribbons are to be awarded for a
dictatorship of any power. The current wording does not reflect this -
it instead permits black ribbons to be awarded for controlling a body of
law. Since part of the idea of bodies of law was to expand them to
regulations and contracts, this is a ticking time-bomb that could result
in giving black ribbons to anybody capable of forming a contract.]
