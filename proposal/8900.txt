Amend Rule 2643 ("Collecting Stones") by replacing the final paragraph
with the following:

{

When a Collection Notice is published, for each player, half (rounded
up) of eir non-immune stones with slipperiness not less than the Escape
Minimum are transferred to Agora. A Collection Notice includes
selections of which eligible stones escape (which shall prevail in
determining which stones are transferred). the mossiness of each stone
that is not transferred is incremented by 1.

}


[Removes the possibility of transferring stones to a single person to
ensure only one can possible escape.]
