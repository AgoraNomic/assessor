Amend Rule 1885 (Zombie Auctions) by replacing:
  For the purpose of such a auction, to transfer a zombie to a player
  is to set that zombie's master switch to that player.
with:
  For the purpose of such a auction, to transfer a zombie to a player
  is to set that zombie's master switch to that player, and Agora CAN
  perform such transfers of the appropriate lots to auction winners.

and by inserting a line break immediately before the resulting text so
that it is a new paragraph.

Amend Rule 2551 (Auction End) by deleting "at will".
