Create a new rule entitled "Ping Pong" with Power=0.1 that reads:

  The first public message sent by a player each Agoran day must
  begin with the word ping (case-insensitive). The second public
  message sent by a player each Agoran day must end with the word
  pong (case-insensitive).

  If a player fails to include ping or pong as mandated by the
  previous paragraph, then, in that same Agoran day, any player CAN
  once revoke one coin from em.
