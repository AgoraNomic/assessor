[persuasion: Instead of inserting subgames into the rules... we have
been inserting subgames directly into the rules, and creating the
"contests" rule.]
Amend Rule 2348 ("Ribbons") by appending another paragraph after the
one starting with "Orange (O):" with the text:
{
Yellow (Y): When a tournament that a player was a gamemaster of ends
with a winner, that gamemaster earns a Yellow Ribbon.
}
