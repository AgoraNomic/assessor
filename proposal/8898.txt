[The current system for stones is unbalanced. The system in this
proposal creates a sort of investment-based auction, where each player
has a default investment of 0, a handicap of -1 for each stone e owns,
and gains 1 each week that e has the garden dream. Then each week,
players can "reach" for a specified stone, and the player with the
highest value (timing tiebroken) gets eir specified stone. It also makes
the mossiness of a stone Agora owns irrelevant, so you can reach for any
it owns.]

Amend R2642 to read in full:

     Base Rockiness is a player switch, with values of integers and
     default of 0, tracked by the Stone Collector. A player's Modified
     Rockiness is eir Base Rockiness minus the number of stones e owns.

     Once a week each player CAN "reach" for a specified stone owned by
     Agora by announcement.

     At the beginning of each week, the stone specified by the player
     with the highest Modified Rockiness that reached for a stone in the
     previous week is transferred to em. In a tie, the stone specified by
     the tied player who reached first is transferred to em. When a
     player receives a stone in this way, eir Base Rockiness is set to 0.

Amend R2643 by replacing "The mossiness of all stones that are not
transferred" with "The mossiness of all stones not owned by Agora"

Amend R2675 (Dream of Wandering) by replacing the paragraph that starts
with "- Gardens" with:

     - Gardens: Immediately after a wandering, the Base Rockiness of each
                Gardens Dreamer is increased by 1.
