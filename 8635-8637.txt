ID: 8636
Title: Points
Adoption index: 1.5
Author: G.
Co-authors: 


Create the following power=1.5 rule, Points:

  A player's Score, indicated in Points, is an integer player switch
  defaulting to 0, tracked by the Herald.

  Upon a correct announcement from a player that one or more players
  have a score of 100+ points, all players meeting this condition
  win the game.  If a least one player wins the game via such an
  announcement, all players' scores are set to their default.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8637
Title: Basic Scoring v0.2
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: Janet


Create the following rule, "Scoring":

  Each time a player fulfills a scoring condition, the officer
  associated with the condition CAN once by announcement, and SHALL
  in an officially timely fashion, add to that player's score the
  associated amount of points.

  Below is a list of scoring conditions and their associated points
  and officers.

    * Being the author of a sponsored proposal that takes effect:
      1 + the power of the proposal when it takes effect (Assessor).

    * Being the coauthor of a sponsored proposal that takes effect:
      1 (Assessor).

    * Having submitted an unconditional ballot AGAINST a referendum on
      a sponsored proposal, provided that the ballot is valid at
      the time the referendum is assessed, and provided that the outcome
      of that assessment is ADOPTED:  points equal to the voting
      player's voting strength on the referendum (Assessor).

[note: using "1 + the power of the proposal when it takes effect" instead
of "the AI of the proposal" because the AI is unlimited while power
iscapped at 4 by R106].

[v0.2 - specified "add" instead of "change".
      - change in referendum wording suggested by Jason.
