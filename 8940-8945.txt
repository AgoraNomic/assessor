//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8942
Title: Cleaning
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: 4st
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2573 ("Impeachment") by replacing "otherwise shown emself
unworthy the trust of Agora."
with "otherwise shown emself unworthy of the trust of Agora."

Amend "Mother, May I?" (Rule 2152)
by replacing { "SHOULD } with { SHOULD }

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8943
Title: Ritual rewrite
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: G.


Amend Rule 2680 to read, in whole:
{

Each of the following is a ritual act:
- Issuing a Cabinet Order.
- Assigning a judgement to a CFJ.
- Publishing the first report of a given Rules-defined type in an Agoran
week, provided such publishing fulfilled a Rules-defined duty to publish.
- For each person, eir becoming a candidate in an election for the first
time in an Agoran week.
- For each person, eir submitting a ballot on an Agoran decision for the
first time in an Agoran week.

When a ritual act is performed, any player CAN, within 7 days, by
announcement anoint a ritual number, specifying the ritual act and the
new ritual number. The anointed ritual number must be 0 or not more than
1 greater than the greatest previously anointed ritual number.

When a positive integral multiple of 41 is anointed as a ritual number
for the first time, the person who does so CAN, by announcement, Raise
the First Speaker in a powerful dance around the Town Fountain. Doing so
causes each player qualifying under this Rule to gain 1 radiance.

A player is qualifying under this Rule if and only if e is active, does
not have the highest radiance of any player, and is not tied for the
highest radiance among players.

}

Amend Rule 1006 by replacing the final paragraph with the following:

{

Immediately after a proposal finishes taking effect, if one or more
offices exist that did not exist prior to the proposal taking effect,
each such office, if it is vacant, becomes held by the author of the
proposal.

}

Amend Rule 2657 by replacing each instance of "proposal that takes
effect" with "proposal that takes effect, at the instant it finishes
taking effect" and by replacing "Having an Agoran Birthday: X, where X
is the number of active players during eir birthday". with "Having an
Agoran Birthday, at the instant it begins: X, where X is the number of
active players at the instant the condition was fulfilled."
