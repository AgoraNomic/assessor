If,\nbut for this sentence, Rule 101 would not exist as a rule after this proposal\nceases taking effect, then the remainder of this proposal has\nno effect.\n\n\nEnact a new power-3.5 rule entitled \"Statutory Instrumentation\nSimultaneity\", reading:\n\n  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the proposal which enacted this\n  rule CAN make multiple rule changes, which it could otherwise make\n  individually, simultaneously. When it attempts to do so, if any single\n  rule change it attempts is INEFFECTIVE, then so is the entire attempt.\n\n  If the proposal which enacted this rule makes a change to the\n  definition of a rule then, except for rules which are simultaneously\n  and explicitly enacted or repealed with that change,\n  the rules after that change are exactly the entities that were rules\n  beforehand. This is a definition of the interpretation of the\n  amendment to the rules and not, in and of itself, a rule change.\n\n\nApply the following rule changes simultaneously: {\n\n  Repeal Rule 2611, \"Instruments\".\n  Repeal Rule 2612, \"Bodies of Law\".\n  Repeal Rule 2613, \"Effects of Instruments\".\n\n  Amend Rule 1688, \"Power\", by, all as part of the same amendment,\n    1. Replacing:\n        A statute is a document with positive Power.\n       with:\n        An instrument is an entity with positive Power.\n    2. Replacing:\n        A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter\n        the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that\n        change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as\n        allowed by a Statute with Power greater than or equal to the\n        change's Power Threshold.\n      with:\n        A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter\n        the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that\n        change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as\n        allowed by an instrument with Power greater than or equal to the\n        change's Power Threshold.\n\n\n  Amend Rule 2438, \"Ribbons\", by replacing \"A statute\" with \"An instrument\".\n\n\n  Amend Rule 105, \"Rule Changes\" by, all as part of the same\n  amendment:\n    1. Replacing:\n        Where permitted by other rules, a statute generally can, as\n        part of its effect,\n      with:\n        When the rules provide that an instrument takes effect, it can\n        generally:\n    2. Replacing each instance of \"statute\" with \"instrument\".\n\n\n  Amend Rule 2140, \"Power Controls Mutability\", by changing it to read in full:\n\n    Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no entity with power below\n    the power of this rule can\n\n    1. cause an entity to have power greater than its own.\n\n    2. adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than its own.\n\n    3. set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument\n       with power greater than its own (that is, one that affects\n       the instrument's operation).\n\n\n  Amend Rule 2125, \"Regulated Actions\", by changing it to read in full:\n\n    An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or\n    permit its performance; (2) the Rules describe the circumstances under\n    which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action would, as part\n    of its effect, modify information for which some player is\n    required to be a recordkeepor.\n\n    A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the\n    Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the\n    Rules for performing the given action. The Rules SHALL NOT be\n    interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.\n\n\n  Amend Rule 2141, \"Role and Attributes of Rules\", by replacing:\n\n    A rule is an enduring statute. Every rule has a power between 0.1\n    and 4.0, inclusive. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, it is\n    IMPOSSIBLE to enact a rule with power outside this range, or to\n    change the power of an existing rule to a nonzero value outside\n    this range. The set of all currently-existing rules is called the\n    ruleset.\n\n  with:\n\n    A rule is a type of instrument that is always taking effect\n    and has the capacity to govern the game generally. A rule's content\n    takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope. The ruleset\n    is the set of all currently-existing rules.\n\n    Every current rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive.\n\n\n  Amend Rule 106, \"Adopting Proposals\", by changing it to read in full:\n\n    When a referendum on a proposal is resolved, if the outcome is ADOPTED,\n    then the proposal in question is adopted, its power is set to the minimum\n    of four and its adoption index, and it takes effect. Proposals CANNOT\n    otherwise be adopted or take effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\n    When a proposal takes effect, the proposal applies the changes that it\n    specifies, except as prohibited by other rules. Clearly marked comments\n    are ignored. If the proposal cannot make some changes it specifies, that\n    does not preclude the other changes from taking place.\n\n    Except insofar as the actions performed by a proposal happen one after\n    another, rather than simultaneously, a proposal's effect is\n    instantaneous. A proposal can neither delay nor extend its own effect.\n    Once a proposal finishes taking effect, its power is set to 0.\n\n    No entity with power below the power of this rule can prevent a proposal\n    from taking effect; this does not apply to generally preventing changes to\n    specified areas of the gamestate, nor to a proposal preventing itself from\n    taking effect (its no-effect clause is generally interpreted as applying\n    only to the rest of the proposal).\n\n}\n\nRepeal the rule \"Statutory Instrumentation Simultaneity\" enacted\nearlier in this proposal."

This just makes them feel nicer to use. Also the Buying\n   Strength cap is gone.\n\n* Adds a weekly reward for having the highest strength. So there's\n   incentive to consider using them even when you're not trying to force\n   through/sink a proposal.\n\n* Removes the Economy focus. Since EVs will give a cash reward, they\n   fill the same niche as this focus but in a more interesting way.\n   Additionally, removing one focus makes the others more competitive.\n]\n\nAmend R2422, \"Voting Strength\", by replacing:\n\n  A player CAN Buy Strength by paying 1 Extra Vote and specifying a\n  current Agoran decision on which e is a voter. For each time a\n  player has Bought Strength on a decision, eir voting strength is 1\n  greater on that decision. If the decision is on a proposal, and\n  the proposal's chamber and the player's focus are the same value,\n  then eir voting strength is instead 2 greater on that decision.

A\n  player's Voting Strength on an ordinary referendum is 1 greater\n  for every time e Bought Strength during that decision's voting\n  period.\n\nAmend R2645, \"The Stones\", by replacing:\n\n  - Power Stone (weekly, 40%): A specified player hereby buys\n    strength 3 times on a specified unresolved Agoran decision.\n\nwith:\n\n  - Power Stone (weekly, 40%): A specified player hereby Buys\n    Strength 3 times.\n\nRepeal R2637, \"Office Interests\".\n\nRepeal R2607, \"Proposal Chambers\".\n\nAmend R1607, \"Distribution\", by replacing \"the text, author, coauthors,\nclass and (if applicable) chamber\" with \"the text, author, coauthors,\nand class\".\n\nAmend R2350, \"Proposals\", by removing:\n\n  * A chamber to which the proposal shall be assigned upon its\n    creation.\n\nAmend R103, \"The Speaker\", by removing:\n\n  The Speaker has voting strength one greater than e would have if\n  e did not hold the office.\n\nAmend R2624, \"Card Administration, by removing:\n\n  Ministry of Economy: 50 boatloads of coins divided by X, rounded\n  up; where X is the number of players with their Ministry Focus set\n  to Economy. The Ministor SHALL report this value in a timely\n  manner after the beginning of the month.\n\nEnact a new Power 1 rule titled \"Vocal Voter Verification Award\" with\nthe following text:\n\n  The sole player, if any, who had the highest voting strength among\n  all votes cast on all decisions resolved in the last 7 days CAN\n  once grant emself 7 boatloads of coins by announcement, provided\n  that no referenda initiated in the same message as it remain\n  unresolved."
