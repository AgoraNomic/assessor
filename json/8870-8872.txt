E\n  SHOULD specify the stone when doing so.\n}\n\n# Remove the concept of \"scroll\"s as a document, which may or may\n# not work, and replace it with more wishy-washy \"description of\n# properties\", which includes continuous effects like voting\n# strength.\n#\n# Also, secure wielding.\n\nAmend Rule 2640 by replacing the text \"A scroll, which is a document\nspecifying the effects of the stone\" with the text \"A description of\nthe stone's properties\".\n\nAmend Rule 2641 by replacing the final paragraph with the following\nparagraphs:\n{\n  When a stone is wielded, the Rule defining that stone applies any\n  effects that it defines as occurring when the stone is wielded.\n\n  The wielding of stones is secured.\n}\n\nAmend Rule 2645 (\"The Stones\") to read, in whole:\n{\n  The following stones are defined, one per paragraph, with the\n  following format: Stone Name (Frequency, Smoothness): Description.\n\n  - Power Stone (weekly, 2): When this stone is wielded, a specified\n    player (defaulting to the wielder if not specified) is Power\n    Stoned; Power Stoning is secured. A player's voting strength on\n    a referendum on an ordinary proposal is increased by 3 for each\n    time that e was Power Stoned during the referendum's voting\n    period.\n\n  - Soul Stone (weekly, 3): When wielded, the Soul Stone is\n    transferred to the owner of a different specified non-immune\n    stone, then that stone is transferred to the wielder.\n\n  - Sabotage Stone (weekly, 4): When wielded, the adoption index of\n    a specified AI-majority Agoran decision is increased by 1.\n\n  - Jockey Stone (monthly, 3): When wielded, a specified Running\n    horse's Race Position is increased by 1.\n\n  - Protection Stone (monthly, 4): When wielded, a specified stone\n    is granted immunity.\n\n  - Recursion Stone (Monthly, 4): The Recursion Stone can be wielded\n    once per month as if it had the power of any other stone of your\n    choice.\n\n  - Hot Potato Stone (Weekly, 5):  When this stone is wielded, the\n    wielder specifies an eligible player and gains 8 points. The\n    stone is transferred to the eligible player. An eligible player\n    is one who has not owned this stone since the last time Agora\n    owned it. If this  stone is not owned by Agora, it cannot\n    otherwise be transferred, other rules notwithstanding. This\n    stone is immune if 3 or more players have wielded it since the\n    most recent collection notice.\n\n  - Blank Stone (Monthly, 0): This stone has no effect.\n\n  - Mason's Stone (None, 0): If the Mason's Stone is owned by the\n    Stonemason, its Mossiness is continuously set to 0. If the\n    Mason's Stone is owned by Agora, it is transferred to the\n    Stonemason.\n\n  - Anti-Equatorial Stone (Monthly, 5): When wielded, the mossiest\n    stone is transferred to the wielder. When this happens, the\n    Anti-Equatorial Stone's mossiness is incremented by 1.\n\n  - Score Stone (Weekly, 3): When wielded, a specified player's\n    (defaulting to the wielder if not specified) Score is increased\n    by 3.\n}"

Immediately after a wandering, if a\n          revolution is not happening, then all players with the\n          Revolution Dream have eir score decreased by 1 to a minimum of\n          0. Immediately after a wandering, if a revolution is happening,\n          then all players have eir score set to 100-X, where X was eir\n          score when the wandering occured, and all player's Dreams are\n          set to Wandering.\n\nsnail becomes the Dream Keeper.\n\nAmend R2632 (Complexity) by adding the following paragraph to the end:\n\n        For each office a player holds, eir voting strength is increase\n        by the complexity of the office for referenda on ordinary\n        proposals, up to a maximum increase of 3 by this method."
