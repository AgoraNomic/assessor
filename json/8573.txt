The device is a\n      singleton switch with values off (default) and on.  The Mad\n      Engineer CAN flip the device to either on or off with Agoran\n      Consent; any other player CAN do so with 2 Agoran Consent.\n\n      The Mad Engineer CAN act on behalf of\n      the device to take any action that the device may take, and\n      SHALL act on behalf of the device to ensure that the device\n      fulfills all of its duties.\n\n      The Mad Engineer's weekly duties include the performance of the\n      following tasks, in order:\n\n      a) Randomly select exactly one rule.  If the selected rule is\n         either this rule or the rule \"The Device\", then\n         007 has been spotted near the self-destruct button; skip\n         directly to proposal submission.\n\n      b) Select one or more contiguous sentences from the selected\n         rule.\n\n      c) Select exactly one noun from the selected text, and replace\n         each instance of that noun with \"Device\" (including\n         grammatical variations, e.g. replacing \"<noun>'s\" with\n         \"Device's\").\n\n      d) Announce intent to, with Agoran Consent, cause this rule\n         to amend the rule \"The Device\" by inserting the modified\n         text as the last list item in either the \"device on\" or\n         \"device off\" lists in that rule (or, if 007 has been\n         spotted, to repeal both that rule and this one).\n         This intent announcement counts as the Mad Engineers's weekly\n         report.\n\n      If the announcement of intent above is made with the procedure\n      described above, the Mad Engineer CAN, with Agoran Consent, cause\n      this rule to amend the rule \"The Device\" as indicated, and SHALL\n      do so if the intent receives sufficient support.\n\n\nG. becomes the holder of the office of Mad Engineer.\n\nAn election for Mad Engineer is initiated."
