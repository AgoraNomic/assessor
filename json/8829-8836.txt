The person who committed\n       an infraction is its infracter.\n\n       The Investigator for an infraction is the Referee unless e is the\n       infracter. Otherwise, it is the Arbitor.\n\n       The Class of an infraction is 2 unless a rule specifies a\n       different Class for it.\n\n       The Base of an infraction is N, where N is the number of\n       previously-investigated, unforgiven infractions that have been\n       committed by the same person in the last 30 days. The previous\n       notwithstanding, if the base of an infraction would be greater\n       than its class, the infraction's base is equal to its class.\n\n       Within 14 days of an infraction being committed, the Investigator\n       CAN investigate the infraction by announcement, specifying a\n       number of blots between the Base and the Class of the infraction,\n       inclusive. When e does so, that many blots are created in the\n       possession of the infracter.\n\n       The previous notwithstanding, an Investigator CANNOT investigate\n       an infraction that has already been investigated or forgiven. The\n       Investigator of a noted, unforgiven infraction SHALL investigate\n       the infraction in a timely manner after it has been noted; failure\n       to do so is the Class N crime of Favoritism, where N is equal to\n       the Class of the noted infraction.\n\n       A player CAN, by announcement, \"note\" an unforgiven infraction\n       committed by any other player in the last 7 days, specifying the\n       incident and the rule it violates (or name of the Infraction if it\n       has one).\n\n       The Referee's weekly report contains a list of noted and\n       investigated Infractions committed in the previous week.\n\nEnact a new P=1.7 rule titled \"Forgiveness\" with the following text:\n\n       All infractions that have not been forgiven are unforgiven.\n\n       Any player CAN, with Agoran Consent, \"forgive\" an unforgiven\n       infraction that occured in the last 30 days. When an infraction is\n       forgiven, if the infraction was investigated, a number of blots in\n       the possession of the infracter equal to the number of blots\n       specified by the investigation are destroyed or, if e has less\n       blots than specified, all eir blots are destroyed. The previous\n       notwithstanding, a player cannot forgive or support an intent to\n       forgive eir own infraction.\n\nReenact R2531, \"Defendant's Rights\", with the following text:\n\n       An infraction is automatically forgiven if:\n\n         (1) the alleged infracter can't be established by a\n             preponderance of the evidence to have committed the\n             infraction\n\n         (2) at the time the alleged infraction occured, it was not an\n             infraction;\n\n         (3) the infraction was for failure to take an action that the\n             infracter, through no fault of eir own, COULD NOT have\n             performed;\n\n         (4) the infraction is for conduct that the infracter, through no\n             fault of eir own, was obliged to undertake by a rule of\n             equal or greater power to the one e violated; or\n\n         (5) the infracter could not have avoided the infraction when\n             exercising the highest reasonably possible standard of care;"
