A contract may also be terminated with the\n  consent of all parties. A contract automatically terminates if the number of\n  parties to it falls below one. It is IMPOSSIBLE for a person to\n  become a party to a contract without eir consent.\n\n  Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in\n  accordance with that contract. This obligation is not impaired\n  by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or\n  between the contract and the rules.\n\n  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any change that would cause the full\n  provisions or parties of a contract to become publicly unavailable is canceled\n  and does not take effect.\n\n  The portion of a contract's provisions that can be interpreted\n  with reference only to information that is either publicly or generally\n  available are known as its body; the remainder of the provisions are known\n  as the annex.\n\n  A party to a contract CAN perform any of the following actions as\n  explicitly and unambiguously permitted by the contract's body:\n\n  * Act on behalf of another party to the contract.\n\n  * By announcement, revoke destructible assets from the contract.\n\n  * By announcement, transfer liquid assets from the contract to a specified\n    recipient.\n\nAmend rule 2450, \"Pledges\", by adding at the end of the first paragraph\n\"A pledge ceases to exist at the end of its time window.\"\n\nDestroy every pledge with an expired time window.\n\nEnact a new power 2.0 rule, entitled \"The Notary\", with the following text:\n\n  The Notary is an office.\n\n  The Notary's weekly report contains:\n\n  1. every pledge, along with its title, creator, time window, time of\n     creation, and time of expiry; and\n  2. every contract, with its title, full provisions, and parties.\n\n  If the Notary is required to report a title, but none has been otherwise\n  publicly provided, e CAN select one.\n\n  The transitional period lasts for at least 90 days after this rule comes\n  into force; thereafter, any player CAN end it by announcement.\n  A pledge or contract is invisible if it was created before this rule came\n  into force, and has not been publicly posted since this rule came into force;\n  for a contract, this publication must include its full provisions and list of\n  parties, along with a certification or adequate proof of their accuracy and\n  completeness. During the transitional period, the Notary NEED NOT report\n  any invisible contract or pledge. When the transitional period is ended,\n  each invisible contract or pledge ceases to exist in the order they were\n  created, and then this rule amends itself by deleting this paragraph.\n\nMake Gaelan the Notary."
