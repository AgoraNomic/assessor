Additionally, such announcement must either clearly and\nunambiguously specify the correct set of assets for that fee or use\nsimplified wording (e.g. \"I buy X\") that makes the intended fee\nreasonably clear and unambiguous (in particular, without stating an\nincorrect fee).\n\n}\n\n* Replacing the text \"If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and\nthe Actor CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient\"\nwith the text \"If the Rules specify a recipient for the relevant fee,\nand the Actor CAN transfer that fee from emself to the recipient\"\n\n* Replacing \"and the Actor CAN destroy the specified fee in eir\npossession\" with \"and the Actor CAN destroy the relevant fee in eir\npossession\".\n\n\n[More closely mirror the \"by announcement\" standard, remove the crime\n(instead simply making the attempt ineffective), and fix a bug:\nreferences to the \"specified fee\" later in the rule are now wrong, since\nthe fee is not always specified. This second version also adds missing\nclarity requirements.]"

When it reaches this maximum, the seed\nwill grow.\n\nEach player can, by paying a fee of 100 pyrite, feed the tower, which\nincreases the seed's magical essence by 1.\n\nAnd when the seed grows, as fate demands, this Rule takes effect, by\nenacting a new Rule, with title \"The Tower\", a power of 1, and 4 paragraphs\nof text provided by the greatest architects, and it should be looked upon\nwith AWE.\n\nThe greatest architects are those persons which have fed the tower the most\ntimes, and also provided a paragraph. The architect in first supplies the\nfirst paragraph, specifying its text by announcement. E NEED NOT specify\nthat it is the first paragraph, merely that it is a paragraph meant to be\nengraved on the tower's walls. The same is true for the architect in second\nand the second paragraph, the third and the third, the fourth and the\nfourth.\n\nIn the event of a tie, should such a conflict arise, the tie will be broken\nwith the person possessing more radiance being greater, and if conflict\nstill, greater in pyrite, then in time since each last registered.\n\nIf 4 paragraphs cannot be determined, a grave outcome indeed, then each\nparagraph that can be determined is included instead of all 4 in balance,\nand the tower SHOULD be looked upon with MUCH FEAR.\n\nIt would be wise to engrave words of power on the tower, for it will be the\nsource of all magic in Agora. Interlopers may seek to change the engravings\nafter its construction, but doing so is ILL-ADVISED, and may result in dark\nforces being unleashed on the perpetrators.\n\nAnd when fate has come to pass, after the seed has grown, and the tower\ndemands to be looked on with AWE or FEAR, only then will this rule take\neffect to repeal itself, and the age of magic will be upon Agora, for\nBETTER or WORSE.\n}}}"
