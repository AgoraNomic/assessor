Oath) to perform (or\n  refrain from performing) certain actions, then breaking the pledge\n  within the pledge's time window is the Class N crime of\n  Oathbreaking, where N is 2 unless the pledge explicitly states\n  otherwise. It is also Oathbreaking for a player to let a pledge\n  expire without taking an action e pledged to do in that pledge.\n  The time window of a pledge is 60 days, unless the pledge\n  explicitly states otherwise. A pledge ceases to exist at the end\n  of its time window.\n\n  If breaking the pledge harms specific other parties, the Referee\n  SHOULD solicit the opinion of those parties in determining an\n  appropriate fine.\n\n  The Notary CAN destroy a pledge Without Objection, but SHOULD NOT\n  do so unless the pledge no longer serves any significant purpose.\n]\n\nAmend Rule 2450, \"Pledges\", by changing it to read in full:\n\n  If a consenting Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to perform\n  (or refrain from performing) certain actions, then breaking the pledge\n  is ILLEGAL; doing so is the Class N crime of Oathbreaking, where N is the\n  value explicitly stated by the pledge, or 2 if the pledge does not explicitly\n  state a value. Allowing a pledge to expire without carrying out an action\n  one pledged to do in it constitutes breaking the pledge.\n\n  The time window of a pledge is W days, where W is the value explicitly\n  stated by the pledge, or 60 if the pledge does not explicitly state a\n  value. A pledge ceases to exist at the end of its time window.\n\n  If breaking the pledge harms specific other parties, the Referee\n  SHOULD solicit the opinion of those parties in determining an\n  appropriate fine.\n\n  The Notary CAN destroy a pledge Without Objection, but SHOULD NOT\n  do so unless the pledge no longer serves any significant purpose.\n\n\n[Promises can arguably be created without consent. Currently the rule purports\nto authorize non-player persons to create promises, which is pretty pointless\nand doesn't really work because non-players can't own promises. In addition,\ncurrently one must grant oneself a promise and then transfer it; this is an\nunnecessary extra step.]\n\nAmend Rule 2618, \"Promises\", by replacing:\n\n  A person CAN, by announcement, grant emself a promise, specifying its text\n  and becoming its creator.\n\nwith:\n\n  A consenting player CAN, by announcement, grant a specified entity a promise,\n  specifying its text and becoming its creator.\n\n[Currently it is arguably the reports and the tabular data that is in violation\nof the rule.]\nAmend Rule 2143, \"Official Reports and Duties\", by replacing:\n\n  Reports SHALL be published in plain text. Tabular data must line\n  up properly when viewed in a monospaced font. Publishing a report\n  that deviates from these restrictions is the Class 2 Crime of\n  Making My Eyes Bleed.\n\nwith:\n\n  An officer SHALL publish eir report in plain text, with tabular data lining\n  up properly when viewed in a monospaced font.
