            "text": "Amend Rule 2595 (Performing a Dependent Action) to read:\n\n  A rule that purports to allow a person (the performer) to perform\n  an action by a set of one or more dependent actions thereby allows\n  em to perform the action by announcement if all of the following\n  are true:\n\n  1. A person (the initiator) published an announcement of intent\n    that unambiguously, clearly, conspicuously, and without\n    obfuscation specified the action intended to be taken and the\n    method(s) to be used, including these values if relevant:\n\n      * If the action is to be taken with T notice, then the value\n        of T.\n\n      * If the action is to be taken without N objections, with N\n        support, or with N Agoran Consent, and N is not equal to 1,\n        then the value of N.\n\n  2. The time between the announcement of intent and the action is\n    at most 14 days. In addition:\n\n      * If the action is to be taken without N objections or with N\n        Agoran consent, then it is at least 4 days.\n\n      * If the action is to be taken with T notice, then it is at\n        least T (minimum of 4 days).\n\n  3. At least one of the following is true:\n\n      * The performer is the initiator.\n\n      * The initiator was authorized to perform the action due to\n        holding a rule-defined position now held by the performer.\n\n      * The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the\n        action depends on support, the performer has supported the\n        intent, and the rule authorizing the performance does not\n        explicitly prohibit supporters from performing it.\n\n  4. Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by\n    other Rules.\n\n  5. If the announcement of intent stated any conditions, then those\n    conditions are all met.\n\n  If the action is to be taken with N Agoran consent, then the\n  performer SHOULD publish a list of supporters and objectors.\n\nAmend Rule 2124 (Agoran Satisfaction) to read:\n\n  A Supporter of an intent to perform an action is an eligible\n  entity who has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support for an\n  announcement of that intent.\n\n  An Objector to an intent to perform an action is an eligible\n  entity who has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) an objection to\n  the announcement of that intent.\n\n  The entities eligible to support or object to an intent to perform\n  an action are, by default, all players, subject to modification by\n  the document authorizing the dependent action. However, the\n  previous sentence notwithstanding, the initiator of the intent is\n  not eligible to support it, and a person CANNOT support or object\n  to an announcement of intent before the intent is announced, or\n  after e has withdrawn the same type of response.\n\n  Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action\n  unless at least one of the following is true:\n\n  1. The action is to be performed without N objections, and there\n    are at least N Objectors to that intent.\n\n  2. The action is to be performed with N support, and there are\n    fewer than than N Supporters of that intent.\n\n  3. The action is to be performed with N Agoran consent, and the\n    number of Supporters of that intent is less than or equal to N\n    times the number of Objectors to that intent.\n\n  4. The action is to be performed without N objections or with N\n    Agora consent, and an objection to that intent was withdrawn\n    within the past 24 hours.\n\n  5. The Speaker objected to that intent within the past 48 hours."
