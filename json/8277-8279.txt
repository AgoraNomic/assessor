This is a sensible place to draw the line, but\n  verifying that for a whole set of messages is arguably more trouble\n  than it's worth. AFAIK no scams were attempted, apart from a Win by\n  Apathy that was already objected to; and even once we verify that a\n  message was received by enough people, we still have to keep track of\n  which of those messages have or haven't already been verified.\n\nH.
