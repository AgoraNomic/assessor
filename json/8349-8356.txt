            "text": "=Administrative Law Reform. I. Statutory Instrumentation.=\n\n[This first proposal is a reform to the core rules defining what rules\nare, with an aim to better supporting subordinate legal documents. The\nintent is to enact very little change to the game as it is actually\nplayed, and to operate mostly in the realm of supporting definitions.]\n\nIf this proposal has had any provision vetoed, then the entire\nproposal has no effect. If this proposal has already taken effect,\nthen it has no effect.\n\nIn this proposal, \"I->S\" is to amend a rule within the scope specified\nby replacing each instance of \"an instrument\" with \"a statute\", and\neach other instance of \"instrument\" with \"statute\". This is not a\ncase-sensitive match, however, if the word \"instrument\" being replaced has a\nleading capital, then so does the replacement word \"statute\".\n\nEnact a new power-3.9 rule entitled \"Statutory Instrumentation\nSimultaneity\", reading:\n{{\n  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the proposal which enacted this\n  rule CAN effect multiple rule changes, which it could otherwise effect\n  individually, simultaneously. When it\n  attempts to do so, if any single rule change it attempts is\n  INEFFECTIVE, then so is the entire attempt.\n\n  If the proposal which enacted this rule effects a change to the\n  definition of a rule then, except for rules which are simultaneously\n  and explicitly enacted or repealed with that change, as appropriate,\n  the rules after that change are exactly the entities that were rules\n  beforehand. This is a definition of the interpretation of the\n  amendment to the rules and not, in and of itself, a rule change.\n}}\n\n[This proposes to make multiple interlocking amendments to critical\nrules defining rules and the interactions between themselves. This\nmitigates a real risk that, during a series of sequential changes, the\nrules would be in a nonsensical or otherwise broken state. I\nconsidered trying to put in a special clause preserving the effect of\nthe current rules on rule changes for the duration of the proposal,\nbut that wouldn't preclude the possibility of some other aspect of the\ngame, such as asset holdings, doing something weird in the in-between\nstate. And only a\npersistent rule could elegantly paper over that small weird gap in\ntime. I think simultaneity is the better choice.]\n\nSet the power of all non-rule entities, other than this proposal, to\n0. [This is an important safety as the change to the definition of a\nrule would potentially cause old non-rule instruments to become rules.\nBest not to consider that.]\n\nApply the following rule changes simultaneously:\n\n{{\n  Amend Rule 1688 (Power) by replacing \"An Instrument is an entity with\n  positive Power.\" with \"A statute is a document with positive Power.\"\n  Apply I->S throughout the remainder of the rule.\n\n  Amend rule 2140 (Power Controls Mutability) by replacing \"set or\n  modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument with power\n  greater than its own.\" with \"set or modify any other substantive\n  aspect of an instrument with power greater than its own except as\n  otherwise provided in this rule.\", applying I->S throughout the rest\n  of the rule, and appending a new paragraph reading \"An ephemeral\n  instrument is bound by prohibitions and limitations specified in rules\n  of lower power, unless it explicitly overrides those prohibition(s) as\n  provided for in other rules.\"\n\n  [I don't want to consider what it would mean if PCM prevents rules\n  from interfering with higher-powered proposal. Let's pretend this is\n  just clarifying something super obvious to everyone.]\n\n  Apply I->S throughout Rule 105 (Rule Changes).\n\n  Enact a new power-3 Rule entitled \"Instruments\" reading:\n  {\n    An instrument is a type of document, either ephemeral or enduring,\n    that is defined as such by a body of law. An instrument's text, where\n    otherwise permitted, can be amended from time to time.\n\n    Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an instrument other than a\n    statute CANNOT become binding on a person without eir willful consent,\n    however, consent can be given by implication. In particular,\n    consenting to be bound to an instrument can imply consent to be bound\n    by amendments to it and consent to be bound by other instruments.\n  }\n\n  Enact a new power-3 Rule entitled \"Bodies of Law\" reading:\n  {\n  A body of law is a collection of related instruments and bodies of law\n  whose effects are collective and possibly interdependent, and which is\n  defined as such by a body of law. The statutes of Agora form a body of\n  law with unlimited scope. All other bodies of law are defined by a\n  different body of law, in such a way as to be able to trace their\n  origins back to the statutes of Agora. Two or more bodies of law may\n  jointly define another body of law, but only each of them clearly\n  expresses the intent to participate in a joint definition with each of\n  the others. Otherwise, the definitions are separate, distinct, and\n  unrelated.\n\n  A body of law is governed by all bodies of law which, directly or\n  indirectly, participate in its definition, as well as any body of law\n  specified as governing it by any of its governing law. A body of law\n  is subordinate to the law that governs it, other than itself, and a\n  body of law is\n  superior to the law that it governs, other than itself. For greater\n  certainty, rules to\n  the contrary notwithstanding, the statutes of Agora govern all law and\n  are governed by no law except themselves, and no body of law can be\n  both subordinate to and superior to another.\n\n  With respect to interactions between separate bodies of law, a body of\n  law is generally to be interpreted as acting harmoniously as a single\n  whole. The precedence between, and organization of, instruments in a\n  body of law are internal matters to that body of law and generally do\n  not affect the effect of other bodies of law, except to the extent\n  that they affect the body's operation as a whole.\n\n  The definition of a body of law includes the definition if its scope,\n  being the areas of the game that it governs. By definition, the scope\n  of a body of law is no greater than the union of the scopes of the\n  bodies of law that define it, nor does it include anything which would\n  bring it into direct conflict with superior law. To the extent that a\n  body of law's scope is not explicitly defined by superior law, it is\n  as broad as possible while excluding any effect on any substantive\n  aspect of any body of law, besides itself, that it does not govern.\n\n  Every instrument is a direct member of exactly one body of law; if not\n  specified in its definition, it is a body of law in itself. A given\n  fixation of text may, however, be the text of multiple instruments,\n  each in different bodies of law. The scope of an instrument is the\n  scope of the body of law it forms a part of. To the extent that the\n  provisions of an instrument are outside its scope, they are void and\n  without effect.\n  }\n\n  [This is the core of the reform: a base framework for multiple\n  separate, scoped bodies of law. Rather than an explicit discussion of\n  precedence between laws, a framework of scoping is used. This proposal\n  does not define anything outside of rules and enacted proposals as\n  being instruments and thus part of this framework, in order to allow\n  gradual work on areas of the ruleset such as regulations and\n  contracts.\n\n  The reason for \"bodies of law\" as separate from \"instruments\" is that\n  frequently, bodies of law express themselves collectively. The rules\n  of Agora, for instance, can only be properly interpreted as a whole.\n  Definitions of entities are often spread out, sometimes to the point\n  where it's nearly impossible to pinpoint a single instrument as the\n  source. Bodies of law capture this concept. They also allow more\n  flexibility to be introduced in proposals to come, such as making\n  clear that a body of law can modify definitions in superior law\n  without a conflict. We can also make rules such as Rule 2125 more\n  natural using this technology, see below.\n\n  More importantly, it allows us to create contracts and similar\n  documents that impose obligations and have other legal effect, but\n  without that possibly \"creeping\" upwards and affecting things outside\n  their scope. Contracts, for instance, can be safely defined without\n  fear that they could be used to override lower-powered rules.\n\n  Bodies of law can be nested. This is to allow for, say, the Rules and\n  Regulations to collectively act as a single body of law, but the Rules\n  to act as a body of law within it. In the future this could be the\n  basis for something like Falsifian's modules. I would rather get the\n  mechanism solid and well-tested before touching precedence between\n  rules, however.\n\n  Governance of bodies of law cannot, however, be circular, because\n  while some bodies of law like the rules are self-governing, other\n  circularity could cause more significant problems by causing a law to\n  be subordinate/superior to itself, and I want to avoid thinking about\n  that.\n\n  I've worked hard to prevent any sort of bootstrapping scam by which a\n  body of law could be brought into existence out of nowhere or\n  otherwise come to govern a superior body without its permission.\n  Please examine closely to see if I succeeded!]\n\n  Amend Rule 2125 (Regulated Actions) to read:\n  {\n    An action is regulated by a body of law if (1) its performance is\n    limited, allowed, enabled, or permitted by that body of law; (2) that\n    body of law describes the circumstances under which it would succeed\n    or fail; or (3) it would, as part of its effect, modify information\n    for which some person bound by that body of law is required, by that\n    body of law, to be a recordkeepor.\n\n    If a body of law regulates an action, then to the extent that doing so\n    is within its scope, that body of law prevents the action from being\n    performed except as described within it, including by limiting the\n    methods to perform that action to those specified within it. A body of\n    law does not proscribed any action which it does not regulate.\n  }\n\n  [I'm sad about losing the SHALL NOT there. Violating that would surely\n  have been one of the great Agoran crimes, along with failing to\n  carefully consider the consequences of not reading the ruleset during\n  RtRW.]\n\n  Enact a new power-3 Rule entitled \"Effects of Instruments\" reading:\n  {\n    An instrument's effect is defined by its text, as amended from time to\n    time in accordance with the law governing its operation. A\n    \"substantive\" aspect of an instrument is any aspect that affects the\n    instrument's operation. If an instrument's text contains clearly\n    marked comments then, they have no effect on its interpretation or\n    operation except as that instrument itself specifies, although they\n    remain part of its text. For the purposes of rules concerning the\n    methods by which actions are performed, an instrument taking effect is\n    such a method.\n\n    An enduring instrument is one that it is always taking effect, to the\n    extent it is permitted to so by the Rules and any other applicable\n    instruments. An enduring instrument is always speaking; uses of the\n    present tense in an enduring instrument are interpreted contextually\n    according to the applicable rules of interpretation.\n\n    An ephemeral instrument is one that takes effect only briefly, to\n    effect a number of changes on the game. When it takes effect, the\n    changes specified in its text are applied, provided that the\n    instrument is not prohibited from doing so. Unless otherwise specified\n    by the instrument or by its governing law, the provisions of an\n    instrument are applied sequentially and independently, in the sense\n    that the success or failure of each provision does not depend directly\n    on the success or failure of any other provision.\n\n    An ephemeral instrument has no ongoing effect, except to the extent\n    that the changes it makes have ongoing consequences. It cannot, except\n    by way of an enduring instrument, extend or delay its own effect. An\n    ephemeral instrument CAN, where explicitly permitted to do so by the\n    law governing it, override the effect of an enduring instrument within\n    its scope by modifying, suppressing, or postponing it. Such an\n    override is INEFFECTIVE unless the nature and scope of the override\n    are clearly specified either in the governing law or, where so\n    authorized by the governing law, in the instrument itself.\n\n    An instrument or body of law is not, except where it specifies\n    otherwise, bound by or restricted in any way by any subordinate law\n    and implicitly overrides and takes precedence over all provisions,\n    including outright prohibitions or definitions, of all subordinate\n    law.\n  }\n\n  [This consolidates the existing rules about proposals and rules into\n  one place, since they will need to be reused for other instruments. It\n  also provides explicit override language, mainly intended to ensure\n  that proposals can have free reign over gamestate modification, though\n  that's a separate proposal. Law is not bound by any other law so as to\n  make clear that proposals cannot be restricted by a contract, say.]\n\n  Amend Rule 2141 (Role and Attribute of Rules) to by replacing the\n  first two paragraphs with the following:\n  {\n    A rule is an enduring statute. Every rule has a power between 0.1 and\n    4.0, inclusive. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, it is\n    IMPOSSIBLE to enact a rule with power outside this range, or to change\n    the power of an existing rule to a nonzero value outside this range.\n    The set of all currently-existing rules is called the ruleset.\n  }\n\n  Amend Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) to read as follows:\n  {\n    When a decision about whether to adopt a proposal is resolved, if the\n    outcome is ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted, its\n    power is set to the minimum of four and its adoption index, it takes\n    effect as an ephemeral instrument, and then its power is set to 0.\n    This rule defers to rules that would prevent a proposal from taking\n    effect.\n  }\n\n  [While this proposal does not immediately define any non-rule,\n  non-proposal entities as instruments, the intent is that the creation\n  of subordinate instruments comes implicitly. Thus, for instance, a\n  contract can define a \"sub-contract\" within the scope of its own\n  effect, and this would be recognized within law, once contracts are\n  defined as instruments. Proposals ignore all subordinate law except as\n  specified otherwise; this is a safety provision.\n\n  Note that the deference provision is equivalent to the existing\n  provision about preventing proposals from taking effect being secured,\n  because deference does not override power as a determiner of\n  precedence. So it will defer to any rule of power 3 or greater but\n  take precedence over any lesser-powered rule.]\n}}\n\nRepeal the rule \"Statutory Instrumentation Simultaneity\" enacted\nearlier in this proposal."
