Notably, during the Silver Quill\n   2020 discussions, an honorable mention was given to Interesting\n   Chambers, which I wrote and did revisions on but never wrote the final\n   version of. This kind of stuff has happened before. It isn't too\n   worrying, but it would be nice to not have to work around it. Plus,\n   proposals are cheap. ]\n\nAmend Rule 2582 by replacing:\n\n  - Silver Quill, awardable by the Promotor to the author of a\n    proposal of outstanding merit and influence on the game\n    (additional information: ID Number of the proposal).\n\nwith:\n\n  - Silver Quill, awardable by the Promotor to the author of a\n    proposal of outstanding merit and influence on the game, or to\n    a coauthor, although e SHOULD only do so if it is generally\n    agreed that that coauthor contributed more to that proposal\n    than the person who submitted it (additional information: ID\n    Number of the proposal)."
