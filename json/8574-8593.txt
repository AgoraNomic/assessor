This kind of stuff has happened before. It isn't too\n   worrying, but it would be nice to not have to work around it. Plus,\n   proposals are cheap. ]\n\nAmend Rule 2582 by replacing:\n\n  - Silver Quill, awardable by the Promotor to the author of a\n    proposal of outstanding merit and influence on the game\n    (additional information: ID Number of the proposal).\n\nwith:\n\n  - Silver Quill, awardable by the Promotor to the author of a\n    proposal of outstanding merit and influence on the game, or to\n    a coauthor, although e SHOULD only do so if it is generally\n    agreed that that coauthor contributed more to that proposal\n    than the person who submitted it (additional information: ID\n    Number of the proposal)."
