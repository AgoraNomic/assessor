            "text": "[This proposal seeks to replace the current criminal system with an\nInfraction system. This is meant to be a simplified system that is\nadjusted based on severity.\n\nThe biggest change is that blots are automatic. A class N infraction\ngets N blots as soon as it happens. The Investigator can, however, tweak\nthem up or down. There is some guiding language to encourage this.\n\nBlots are removed weekly by any player that hasn't gained one this week\nor last (to prevent timing silliness). This means serious infractions\nwill either take you a while to recover from, or require multiple\nplayers to forgive you.]\n\nAmend R2555 (Blots) to read, in full:\n\n       Blots are an indestructible fixed currency with ownership\n       restricted to persons. A person with 1 or more blots is Impure, a\n       person with 0 blots is Pure. An impure unregistered person is a\n       Fugitive. The Referee is an office, and the recordkeepor for\n       blots.\n\n       To expunge a blot is to destroy it. Destroying blots is secured\n       with a Power Threshold of 1.7.\n\n       A person CAN, by announcement, create a specified number of blots\n       in eir possession.\n\n       Any player who has not expunged a blot by this method this week\n       CAN expunge 1 blot from a specified player who has not gained a\n       blot this or the previous week, by announcement.\n\n       At the beginning of each quarter, half (rounded down) of each\n       fugitive's blots are destroyed.\n\nAmend R2478 to be titled \"Infractions\" and to read, in full:\n\n     An Infraction is a violation of a SHALL or SHALL NOT in a rule. The\n     infracter for an infraction is the person who committed the\n     infraction.\n\n     The Investigator for an infraction is the Referee unless e is the\n     infracter. Otherwise, it is the Arbitor.\n\n     The Class of an infraction is 2 unless a rule specifies a different\n     Class for it.\n\n     When a player commits an infraction, N blots are created in eir\n     possession, where N is the class of the infraction.\n\n     A player CAN, by announcement, \"note\" an infraction committed by any\n     other player in the last 7 days by specifying the incident and the\n     rule that contains the SHALL or SHALL NOT (or name of the Infraction\n     if it has one). The Investigator of an infraction CAN and SHALL once\n     by announcement grant 1 boatload of coins to the player that noted\n     the infraction in a timely manner after e does so.\n\n     The Referee's weekly report contains a list of Infractions committed\n     in the previous week.\n\n     The Investigator of an infraction CAN, by announcement, \"reduce\" the\n     infraction by specifying a reason and a number between 1 and half of\n     N (inclusive and rounded up), where N is the class of the\n     infraction. When e does so, N (or all if N is greater than all)\n     blots in possession of the infracter are expunged. E SHOULD do so if\n     e believes the infraction was inconsequential or unavoidable, or if\n     e believes the infracter has fixed it or shown remorse.\n\n     The Investigator of an infraction CAN, by announcement, \"increase\"\n     the infraction by specifying a reason and a number between 1 and\n     half of N (inclusive and rounded down), where N is the class of the\n     infraction. When e does so, N blots are created in the infracter's\n     possession. E SHOULD do so if e believes the infraction was harmful,\n     belligerent, or intentional.\n\n     The above notwithstanding, an infraction CANNOT be increased or\n     reduced if it happened more than 14 days ago or it has already\n     been increased or reduced.\n\nRepeal rules 2557 \"Sentencing Guidelines\" and 2531 \"Defendant's Rights\".\n\nAmend Rules 2660 (Birds), 2143 (Official Reports and Duties), 2202\n(Ratification Without Objection), 2450 (Pledges), and 2545 (Auctions) in\nthe given order by replacing every instance of the word \"crime\" with\n\"infraction\"."
