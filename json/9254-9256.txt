To \"publish\" is already defined, and we have a\nperfectly method for actions taken by sending a message: \"by\nannouncement\". I would argue \"This is a Notice of X.\" continues to work\nunder this standard, since one no longer has to explicitly announce that\ne performs a \"by announcement\" action in order to take it, and saying\nthat clearly sets forth intent to take the action of \"issuing\" the Notice.]\n\n\nIf, immediately prior to this proposal taking effect (and under the\nruleset then in effect), the ADoP had published a Notice of Election in\nthe current quarter, any duty for em to issue a Notice of Election in\nthe current quarter is discharged.\n\nIf, immediately prior to this proposal taking effect (and under the\nruleset then in effect), the Referee had published a Notice of\nClemency in the current quarter, any duty for em to issue a Notice of\nClemency in the current quarter is discharged.\n\nIf, immediately prior to this proposal taking effect (and under the\nruleset then in effect), the Illuminator had published a Notice of\nDiminution in the current quarter, any duty for em to issue a Notice of\nDiminution in the current quarter is discharged.\n\n[Clarify that this proposal does not impose any additional duties in the\ncurrent quarter.]\n\n\nAmend Rule 869 (\"How to Join and Leave Agora\") by replacing the text \"by\npublishing a message that indicates reasonably clearly\" with \"by sending\na public message that indicates reasonably clearly\".\n\n[The \"message\" part of this requirement is already included in the\ndefinition of \"publish\".]\n\n\nAmend Rule 2463 (\"Motion of No Confidence\") to read as follows:\n\n{\n\nAny player CAN, with Agoran consent, cause the office of Prime Minister\nto become vacant, provided that the message in which e does so contains\nthe string \"MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE\" in its subject line. Motions of no\nconfidence SHOULD be used whenever Agorans want to shake things up,\nrather than as a personal judgement of the Prime Minister.\n\n}\n\n[Remove the double method (\"with Agoran consent\" and \"by publishing\n[...]\") by phrasing it as a condition instead. Also, fix a typo\n(\"missing \"be\" after \"SHOULD\").]"
