A\nregulation has no effect other than those that the Rules explicitly give\nit.\n}\n* Deleting the sentence beginning \"By default, a person CAN\".\n\n[Mimic the language for assets with regulations. Change the positive \"It\nhas only the effect that rule explicitly gives it\" to a negative version\n(to avoid any chance of power escalation), and allow rules other than a\nregulation's parent rule to give it effects (e.g. R648 for the Herald's\nAdministrative Regulations). Remove promulgators; we already specify how\nevery type of regulation can be changed.]\n\nAmend Rule 2464 (\"Tournaments\") by, as a single amendment, doing the\nfollowing (failing as a whole if any step fails):\n* Deleting the sentence \"The person who initiates a tournament is its\nGamemaster.\".\n* Inserting the following sentence before \"Once the tournament is\nconcluded\": \"When a tournament is initiated, its governing regulations\nare enacted.\". [This makes clear that R2464 is the parent rule.]\n* Appending the following paragraphs:\n{\nUnless otherwise specified by the tournament's regulations, the\ngamemaster of a tournament is the person who initiated it.\n\nA tournament's regulations can provide for the enactment, amendment, and\nrepeal of regulations for that tournament; if the regulations are\nsilent, the gamemaster CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, enact, amend, or\nrepeal such regulations. Any regulations so enacted are deemed to be\nregulations of the same tournament.\n}\n* Replacing the text \"freely consent to play the tournament\" with\n\"freely consent to oversee or participate in the tournament\".\n\nAmend Rule 2495 (\"The Birthday Tournament\") by replacing the text\n\"promulgating a specified, finalized set of tournament regulations\" with\nthe text \"specifying a finalized set of governing regulations\" and by\ndeleting the sentence beginning \"These regulations may thereafter be\namended\".\n\n[\n\n* Allow tournament regulations to provide for changes to themselves.\nRegulations are commonly written as if this is permitted, even though it\nis not.\n\n* Ensure the clause that makes tournaments binding includes gamemasters.\nIf a person is made gamemaster of a tournament without eir consent, e\nstill is not required to abide by the regulations unless e \"freely\nconsent[s]\" to it.\n\n]\n\n\nHereby, every regulation, as defined under the ruleset in effect\nimmediately before this proposal began taking effect, that has never\nbeen repealed and that existed at that time exists in the same form and\nis of the same type as it was at that time.\n\nHereby, every regulation that has never been repealed and that was\noriginally enacted pursuant to the initiation of a tournament is deemed\nto be a regulation of that same tournament for the purposes of Rule 2464.\n\n[Explicitly maintain existing regulations.]"
