Instead of saying \"a player with\nthe X Dream\", this version defines \"X Dreamer\" to mean that, and then\nuses that in each description for brevity/clarity. Also tweaked Power's\nwording.]\n\nAmend R2675 (Dream of Wandering) to read in full:\n\n       The Dream Keeper is an office; its holder is responsible for\n       keeping track of the dreams of all active players.\n\n       Dream is a secured active player switch, tracked by the Dream\n       Keeper in eir weekly report, with possible values any Dream,\n       defaulting to Wandering. An \"X Dreamer\" is a player with eir Dream\n       switch set to X.\n\n       An active player CAN \"envision\" eir own Dream, specifying any\n       valid value for eir Dream, by announcement. When the rules state\n       that the wandering occurs, every active player's Dream is set to\n       the value e most recently envisioned. If a player did not envision\n       a dream since the last wandering, it is not flipped.\n\n       A wandering occurs at the beginning of each week.\n\n       The following is an exhaustive list of all Dreams and the rules\n       relevant to each dream:\n\n       - Wandering: This dream has no effect.\n\n       - Charity: The Charity Item is the item type that the L&FD owns\n         the most of (if there is a tie, the first the L&FD owned, and if\n         still tied, the first alphabetically). Immediately after a\n         wandering, for each Charity Dreamer, in reverse order of when\n         eir Dream was last flipped (and in reverse order of registration\n         if tied), one item of the Charity type is transferred from the\n         L&FD to em.\n\n       - Justice: Immediately after a wandering, 1 blot is expunged from\n         each Justice Dreamer. If a Justice Dreamer had no blots\n         immediately after a wandering, e CAN onceexpunge one blot, by\n         announcement, from a specified player before the next wandering.\n\n       - Sharing: Immediately after a wandering, each Sharing Dreamer has\n         eir points increased by X / Y, rounded down, where X is half the\n         number of active players, rounded up, and Y is the number of\n         Sharing Dreamers.\n\n       - Wealth: Immediately after a wandering, X stamps of eir own type\n         are granted to each Wealth Dreamer. When less than 8 Stamps of\n         eir type exist, X is 2. When 8 to 15 Stamps of eir type exist, X\n         is 1. When 16 ore more Stamps of eir type exist, X is 0.\n\n       - Machinery: A Machinery Dreamer CAN Flip the Device with Agoran\n         Consent. A Machinery Dreamer CAN take a specified action on\n         behalf of the the device with 1 support.\n\n       - Gardens: Once per week, a Gardens Dreamer CAN, by announcement,\n         transfer the mossiest stone (if there is a tie, then a specified\n         stone tied for mossiest) Agora owns to emself. E SHOULD specify\n         the stone when doing so.\n\n       - Power: Each Power Dreamer has eir voting strength increased by 2\n         for referenda on ordinary proposals.\n\n       - Revolution: A revolution is happening if the majority of active\n         players are Revolution Dreamers. Immediately after a wandering,\n         if a revolution is not happening, then all Revolution Dreamers\n         have eir score decreased by 1 to a minimum of 0. Immediately\n         after a wandering, if a revolution is happening, then all\n         players have eir score set to 100-X, where X was eir score when\n         the wandering occured, and all player's Dreams are set to\n         Wandering."
