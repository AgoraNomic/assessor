            "text": "(Instead of defining something by what it IS, lets define something by what\nit ISN'T! Looking forward to more comments on how to proof this a bit more,\nbut most of the proofing should be by the weaving itself.)\nEnact the following rule entitled \"Thaumaturgy\" with power=2:\n{\nEach player, once per month, CAN, by commitment with 1 support, spellweave,\nthereby becoming the mage of that spellweave. Supporters of a spellweave\nare its apprentices.\nThe Plaintext thereof MUST clearly, unambiguously, and trivially state that\nit shall exist within a single category of magic, otherwise it is a miscast.\n\nThe Archmage is an office whose weekly report tracks commitments made by\nthis rule and any magical instruments created or will be created thereof.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, for each spellweave, the mage or apprentices\nCAN, by announcement, reveal the corresponding plaintext in a timely manner\n(this is called casting). Not revealing the plaintext in a timely manner is\na miscast.\nThe Archmage CAN and SHALL, by announcement in a timely manner, grant all\nmages who miscast or have miscast spells 3 blots for miscasting.\n\nAfter the time limit expires for casting, all related Plaintext\nsimultaneously becomes a magical instrument (called a spell) with 0.01\npower, and has the category specified in its Plaintext. The mages and\napprentices of a spellweave are also the mages and apprentices of its\nrespective spell. The Fingerprint of a spellweave is sufficient to specify\nthe spell its Plaintext becomes.\n\nSpells CANNOT:\n- amend, modify, extend, reduce the ruleset or the rules, rules to the\ncontrary notwithstanding.\n- create any instruments, rules to the contrary notwithstanding\n- make anything IMPOSSIBLE\n- specify conditions for winning\n- specify wins\n- cause a paradox\n\nSpells CAN, but are not limited to:\n- make a mess\n- wreak havoc\n- exist\n\nSpells cease to exist (are cancelled) at the beginning of the month after\nthey are created, unless otherwise specified by rules of power 1 or\ngreater. A spell that is cancelled based on time \"expires\".\n\nIn a conflict between spells, if there is otherwise no precedence, the\nspell that was woven first takes precedence, simultaneity to the contrary\nnotwithstanding.\n\nIn a conflict between spells, if one takes precedence over another due to\nthis rule, it happens before the other's effect, rules and simultaneity to\nthe contrary notwithstanding.\n\nIf a spell would be part of a judgement that is PARADOXICAL, all spells\ninvolved in the judgement are miscast, and instead cancelled before taking\nfurther effect.\n\nCFJs CAN, optionally by announcenemt, be submitted to the Archmage, but\nSHALL NOT unless the CFJ relates to spells. CFJs submitted to the Archmage\nCAN and are ENCOURAGED to be judged by any player who is not the submitter\nand is not barred from the CFJ, in order to expedite the ensuing\nthaumaturgic machinations.\n\nWhen the office of Archmage becomes vacant, all spells are cancelled and\nall spellweaving is cancelled, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. The\nArchmage SHALL NOT cause eir office to become vacant, this is a Class 40\nviolation.\n}\n\nEnact the following rule entitled \"Lower Realms\" with power=0.5:\n{\nThe following are additional categories of magic, and their effect.\nCategories higher on this list takes precedence over categories lower on\nthe list, unless otherwise specified by this rule.\n- Seraphic: The only effect a seraphic spell CAN have is to cancel exactly\none specified, non-seraphic spell. When a seraphic spell cancels a spell,\nit also becomes cancelled.\n- Transmogrification: A transmogrification spell CAN ONLY alter definitions\nin every spell that happens after it. Transmogrification spells do not\nexpire.\n- Alacritous: Alacritous spells are cancelled after they take effect.\n- Eldritch: An eldritch spell CANNOT be violated. If an eldritch spell were\nto otherwise be violated, all spells involved in the violation are instead\nmiscast and cancelled before taking effect, thus preventing the IMPOSSIBLE\nviolation. Eldritch spells do not expire.\n- Quantum: A quantum spell has no effect when it begins existing the first\ntime. After a quantum spell is cancelled the first time, it is recreated\nand begins taking effect. Quantum spells do not expire.\n- Feral: Feral spells have no effect except in the context of a Zymotic\nspell.\n- Zymotic: The text describing zymotic spells is to be considered as the\ncombination of all extant feral spells in order of spellweaving, with this\ntext being the default text if no other text exists.\n- Lapidarian: Lapidarian spells take precedence over alacritous spells.\n- Psionic: A psionic spell CAN ONLY combine exactly two specified, existing\nspells in their entirety, but in the specified order. Spells combined this\nway are referred to by either fingerprint, have the combined set of mages\nand apprentices of the original spells, and have all the categories of the\ncombined spells. Spells combined this way are considered a new spell that\nhas started existing for the first time.\n}\n(\nsome notes:\n- meant for there to be some \"rock paper scissors\" dynamic here, but I had\nleft room for others to have more magical categories... then I filled that\nroom myself.\n- Made mages just auto-obtain blots most of the time, to prevent work being\ndone by the Referee. (requires power 1.7)\n- didn't want to give too much advantage for being early in a month: so\nmade it have some simultaneous nature and otherwise lack of precedence\nbetween instruments (requires power 2)\n- this is intended to be a blot engine as players figure out a scam they\n*might* be able to do, barring magical interference.\n- requiring 1 support means that you probably have to share what magic you\nplan to do to get that support, so who do you trust? a team of 2 can get\nyou somewhere, but it's public that that is the team...\n)"
