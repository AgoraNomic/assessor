Immediately after a\n         wandering, for each Charity Dreamer, in reverse order of when\n         eir Dream was last flipped (and in reverse order of registration\n         if tied), one item of the Charity type is transferred from the\n         L&FD to em.\n\nwith:\n\n       - Charity: A Charity Stamp is a stamp of the type that the L&FD\n         owns the most of (if there is a tie, the first the L&FD owned,\n         and if still tied, the first alphabetically). Immediately after\n         a wandering, for each Charity Dreamer, in reverse order of when\n         eir Dream was last flipped (and in reverse order of registration\n         if tied), one Charity Stamp is transferred from the L&FD to em.\n         If the number of Stamps the L&FD owns is greater than the number\n         of active players, this process happens a second time. If it is\n         more than twice the number of active players, this process\n         happens a third time.\n\nand replacing:\n\n       - Revolution: A revolution is happening if the majority of active\n         players are Revolution Dreamers. Immediately after a wandering,\n         if a revolution is not happening, then all Revolution Dreamers\n         have eir score decreased by 1 to a minimum of 0. Immediately\n         after a wandering, if a revolution is happening, then all\n         players have eir score set to 100-X, where X was eir score when\n         the wandering occured, and all player's Dreams are set to\n         Wandering.\n\nwith:\n\n       - Revolution: A revolution is happening if the majority of active\n         players are Revolution Dreamers. Immediately after a wandering,\n         if a revolution is not happening, then all Revolution Dreamers\n         have eir score decreased by 1 to a minimum of 0. Immediately\n         after a wandering, if a revolution is happening, then all\n         players have eir score set to X/Y (rounded down), where X is the\n         sum of all scores when the wandering occurred, and Y is the\n         number of active players."
