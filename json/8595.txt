No reason to have Glitter here at power 3]\n\nAmend rule 2602, \"Glitter\" to read, in full:\n\n  \"Each type of Ribbon has a corresponding type of Glitter\n  with the same name. A player qualifies for a type of Glitter\n  when e qualifies for the same type of Ribbon while already\n  owning such a Ribbon. If a player has not been awarded\n  that type of Ribbon or e corresponding type of Glitter\n  since e last earned or came to qualify for that type of\n  Ribbon, and has not been so awarded five or more times\n  within the past 24 hours, any player CAN award em that\n  type of Glitter by announcement. When a player gains\n  a type of Glitter, the Tailor SHALL in an officially\n  timely fashion and CAN once by announcement award em\n  N/2 boatloads of coins rounded up, where N is the number\n  of players that did not own the corresponding type of\n  Ribbon at the time of the award. The amount payable for\n  each type of Glitter is tracked in the Tailor's weekly\n  report.\n\n[comment: Nonplayer persons can currently get Glitter, they don't need to\nbe able to though because it does nothing. N+1 becomes N/2 because Glitter\nis currently the most powerful way to get coins, by far. ]"
