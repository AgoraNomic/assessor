To flip a player's activity to\n  active (inactive) is to activate (deactivate) em.  The date on\n  which each player's activity was last changed is part of the\n  Registrar's weekly report.\n\n  A player CAN activate or deactivate emself by announcement.\n\n  Any player CAN, with notice, make a player who has not made a\n  public announcement in the past 30 days inactive.\n\n  If a player has been inactive continuously for the past 60 days,\n  then any player CAN deregister em without 3 objections. The\n  Registrar SHOULD attempt to deregister players who meet this\n  condition. The publication of intent for such a deregistration\n  SHOULD be sent to the inactive player's registered email address\n  at the same time that it is published.\n\n\nEvery player's activity is flipped to active [unneeded I think due\nto default behavior, but precautionary?]\n\n\nAmend Rule 2492 (Recusal) by appending the following text to the\nsecond paragraph:\n  The Arbitor CAN recuse an inactive or deregistered judge from a\n  case by announcement.\n\nRepeal Rule 2532 (Zombies).\nRepeal Rule 2574 (Zombie Life Cycle).\nRepeal Rule 2639 (Zombie Phase-Out).\nRepeal Rule 1885 (Zombie Auctions).\n\nAmend Rule 2472 (Office Incompatibilities) by deleting:\n  A zombie is Overpowered if e holds one or more offices.\n\nAmend Rule 2531 (Defendant's Rights) by deleting:\n  (10) it attempts to levy a fine on a zombie for an action that\n       its master performed on its behalf.\n\nAmend Rule 2621 (VP Wins) by replacing \"non-zombie\"  with \"active\".\n\nAmend Rule 2581 (Official Patent Titles) by deleting:\n  - Necromancer, awardable by the Registrar to any player who makes\n    such sufficient persistent legal use of zombies that rules need\n    to be amended to prevent such practices.\n\n[Checked all the other uses of \"active\" and \"inactive\" pertaining to\nplayers, looked like all would work fine under this version]"
