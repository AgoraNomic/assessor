Its purpose is to deregister and, if\npossible, ban Madrid as a sanction for a series of incidents on the\nlists and on the unofficial Discord server. This is not in response to\nany single incident, but rather a pattern of behavior. This is\nadditionally not in response to Madrid's distaste for Spivak pronouns\nitself, regardless of the timing of this submission.\n\nMadrid's actions and views have resulted in two deregistrations (one\nsuccessful FAGE and one attempted FAGE that wasn't a FAGE due to a\ntechnicality), hostile exchanges of words on list, and an atmosphere on\nthe Discord that discourages participation in discussion. No other\nsingle player's non-gameplay actions and expressions of views have\nresulting in similar responses from other players.\n\nThis proposal is phrased in such a way that, if adopted, Madrid will be\nunconditionally deregisted and will be Banned if the associated proposal\n\"Unfortunately\" has been adopted. Even if \"Unfortunately\" has not been\nadopted, the adoption of this proposal represents the AI-3 consensus\nthat Madrid is not welcome. If this occurs, and \"Unfortunately\" failed\ndue to a technical reason rather than apparent rejection of the idea,\nthe author will pursue further proposals to officialize the ban.\n]"
