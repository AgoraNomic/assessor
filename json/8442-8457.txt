When a player corners the market, e wins the game.\n\n  A bargain is a specification consisting of a title, a payout (a\n  number of barrels between 1 and 10), and a tender (a list of 6 or\n  more rules-defined card types; a type may be repeated, with each\n  repeat being a separate element on the list).\n\n  A player CAN cash out a specified bargain that's \"on the barrel\",\n  by announcement, provided that, in the same message, e paid cards\n  (possibly spread over multiple sets) to successfully earn rules-\n  defined products, and those cards match all of the cards types in\n  that bargain's tender.  The payment of a particular card instance\n  can only match a single tender element for the single cashing out\n  of a bargain.\n\n  When a player cashes out a bargain on the barrel, e earns the\n  payout for that bargain.\n\n  The Coopor CANNOT cash out a specific bargain in the 14 days\n  after putting that bargain on the barrel.\n\n\nCreate a power-1 rule, \"Bargains on the Barrel\", with the\nfollowing text:\n\n  If there are fewer than four bargains on the barrel, the Coopor\n  CAN put a bargain on the barrel with notice.  If there are fewer\n  than eight bargains on the barrel, the Coopor CAN put a bargain on\n  the barrel with 3 support.\n\n  The Coopor CAN take a bargain off the barrel without N objections,\n  where N is the number of months, rounded up, since that bargain\n  was last placed on the barrel.  Within 14 days after winning an\n  election for Coopor, the Coopor CAN take any bargain off the\n  barrel with notice.\n\n  The Coopor's monthly report includes a list of all bargains on the\n  barrel.  E SHOULD publish such a list whenever e adds or removes a\n  bargain from the barrel.\n\n\nThere are no bargains on the barrel.\n\nG. is hereby made Coopor.\n\nAn election for Coopor is hereby initiated."
