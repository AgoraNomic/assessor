The\n       Absurdor SHOULD list the largest Height and Slope of the Boulder\n       ever reached in eir report.\n\nwith this text:\n\n       Each player CAN, by announcement, push the Boulder, unless e was\n       the most recent player to do so. When a player pushes the Boulder,\n       if e correctly and unambiguously specified its previous Height,\n       then its Height is increased by 1; otherwise, its Height is set to\n       0. At the beginning of each week, if the Boulder was not pushed in\n       the previous week, then its Height is set to 0. The Absurdor\n       SHOULD list the largest Height of the Boulder ever reached in eir\n       report.\n\n       Upon a correct announcement that the Boulder's Height is at least\n       1000, each player who pushed it at least once since its Height was\n       last 0 Reaches the Summit, then its Height is set to 0. When a\n       player Reaches the Summit, e wins the game.\n\n[Inspired by a Discord bot on another server that implements the same\n  challenge. I've been watching it for a couple months now; it's failed\n  in the 300-600 range about three times, one of which was my fault due\n  to not scrolling down properly.]"
