If not, we can handle them separately. In\nparticular: 1. I wasn't sure what to do about Proposal 8277's possible\ndistribution, and 2. reports may have self-ratified during that\nperiod.\n\nend comment]\n\nWithin the text of this proposal, The Troubles is defined as the period\nstarting at 00:15 UTC on Dec 14, 2019 and ending at 01:45 UTC on Dec\n28, 2019.\n\nDestroy any Coins that were earned during The Troubles and/or as\nrewards for documents published during The Troubles.\n\nReverse any changes to Karma that happened during The Troubles.\n\nIf the Officeholder of Comptroller has not changed since the end of\nThe Troubles, set it to vacant.\n\nDestroy any CFJs created during The Troubles."
