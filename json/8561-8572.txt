            "text": "Create a power=2 rule, \"The Election Cycle\", with the following text:\n\n  A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by\n  winning an election, and has not won an election for that office\n  since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either\n  vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.\n\n  An office is term-limited if the most recent election for that\n  office was resolved more than the length of that office's term\n  prior. The term for the office of Prime Minister is 90 days. The\n  term for all other elected offices is 180 days.\n\n  A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office:\n\n  a) with 2 support, if either the office is interim or term-\n     limited, and provided that the initiator becomes a candidate\n     in the same message.\n\n  b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP (or, if the office is the\n     ADoP, if e is the Assessor) and the office is interim, or if\n     e is the holder of that office.\n\n  Once per quarter, the ADoP CAN and SHALL publish a Notice of\n  Election specifying between 2-4 term-limited offices (if there\n  fewer than 2 term-limited offices, the ADoP MUST instead list\n  all of them).  Such a notice initiates elections for the\n  specified offices.  The ADoP SHOULD prioritize offices that\n  have gone longest since their last elections.\n\n  The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be\n  initiated if one is already in progress.\n\n\n[Delete this section added to the previous rule - better gathers\nelection procedure rules in one place].\n\nAmend Rule 1006 (Offices) by removing:\n  A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by\n  winning an election, and has not won an election for that office\n  since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either\n  vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.\n\n\n[For the below rule, remove text placed in the new rule above,\nand add the Assessor as the vote collector for ADoP elections].\n\nAmend Rule 2154 (Election Procedure) to read in full:\n\n  When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,\n  which lasts for 4 days. After an election is initiated and until\n  nominations close, any player CAN become a candidate by\n  announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e ceases to\n  be a player during the election or if holding the office would\n  make em Overpowered. During the nomination period, a candidate CAN\n  cease to be a candidate by announcement if there is at least one\n  other candidate.\n\n  An election whose nomination period is complete is contested if it\n  has two or more candidates, and uncontested otherwise. Nominations\n  close at the end of the poll's voting period or when the election\n  is ended, whichever comes first.\n\n  After the nomination period ends, the ADoP (or, if the office is\n  the ADoP, the Assessor) CAN and, in a timely fashion, SHALL:\n\n  1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision to\n     select the winner of the election (the poll). For this\n     decision, the Vote Collector is the ADoP (or, if the office\n     is the ADoP, the Assessor), the valid options are\n     the candidates for that election (including those who become\n     candidates after its initiation), and the voting method is\n     instant runoff. When the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a\n     player, wins the election. If the outcome is not a player, the\n     election ends with no winner.\n\n  2) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election\n     immediately.\n\n  If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,\n  then any player CAN by announcement declare em the winner of the\n  election, thereby causing em to win the election. If at any point\n  an uncontested election has no candidates, then any player CAN\n  declare the election ended with no winner by announcement.\n\n  When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated\n  office and the election ends."
