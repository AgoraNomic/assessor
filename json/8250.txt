When a Finger, other than the Arbitor's, is Pointed over\n  an allegation related to the official duties or powers of the\n  Referee, then the Arbitor CAN, by announcement, take over the\n  investigation and thereby become the investigator.\n\n  The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger. The Arbitor CANNOT Point eir\n  Finger at the Referee.\n\nwith this text:\n\n  The above notwithstanding, the investigator CANNOT resolve a\n  Finger Pointing for which e is the perp.\n\n  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger\n  Pointing. If the Referee is the perp, then the Arbitor CAN\n  become the investigator of that Finger Pointing by announcement.\n\n[Limiting resolution is more important than limiting initiation, as\noffices may change hands during the process.]"
