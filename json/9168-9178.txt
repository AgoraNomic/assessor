I don't allocate blame.\n  But now e's resigned too, the position's the same.\n\nIf none of us can the records sustain,\n  Then I think it would be a mistake to retain\n  A system that's such a great chore to maintain.\nSo unless the subgame can be fixed at its bones\n  I plead with you all to take heed of my moans\n  And bring to a close the Era of Stones."

            "text": "[The purpose of this proposal is to unify the language around \"tracking\"\n and \"recordkeepors\", which is currently subtly different for assets and\n switches and has caused a lot of confusion in the past. In particular,\n the word \"recordkeepor\" is currently not defined with respect to\n switches, only to assets; this is causing bizarre behaviour around\n Hats, the intention of which is to be tracked, but not by an officer.]\n\nCreate a new Rule of Power 3.0, entitled \"Recordkeepors\", and reading\nas follows:\n\n      For some entity or class of entities to be \"tracked by\" another\n      entity is for the latter entity to be its recordkeepor.\n\n      For an entity to be a recordkeepor for a type of switch is for\n      that entity to be the recordkeepor for all instances of that\n      switch.\n\n      Where the rules specify a recordkeepor for some set of instances\n      of a switch, that recordkeepor's (weekly, if not specified\n      otherwise) report includes the value of each instance in that set\n      whose value is not its default value; a public document purporting\n      to be this portion of that recordkeepor's report is\n      self-ratifying, and implies that other instances in that set are\n      at their default value.\n\n      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)\n      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That\n      recordkeepor's report includes a list of all instances of that\n      class and their owners. A public document purporting to be this\n      portion of that recordkeepor's report is self-ratifying.\n\nAmend Rule 2166 (Assets) by removing the following:\n\n      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)\n      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That\n      entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class and\n      their owners. A public document purporting to be this portion of\n      that entity's report is self-ratifying.\n\n      For a class of assets to be \"tracked by\" an entity is for that\n      entity to be its recordkeepor.\n\nAmend Rule 2162 (Switches) by removing the following:\n\n      3. Optionally, exactly one office whose holder tracks instances of\n         that switch. That officer's (weekly, if not specified\n         otherwise) report includes the value of each instance of that\n         switch whose value is not its default value; a public document\n         purporting to be this portion of that officer's report is\n         self-ratifying, and implies that other instances are at their\n         default value.\n\nAmend Rule 2603 (Switch Responsibility) to read in full:\n\n      For each type of switch that is not defined as untracked and that\n      has at least one instance that would otherwise lack a\n      recordkeepor, there exists an imposed office named \"Tracker of\n      [type name]\" whose holder tracks those instances.\n\nRename Rule 2143 (Official Reports and Duties) to \"Reports and Duties\",\nand amend it by replacing this text:\n\n      An officer SHALL publish eir report in plain text, with tabular\n      data lining up properly when viewed in a monospaced font.\n      Publishing a report that deviates from these restrictions is the\n      Class 2 infraction of Making My Eyes Bleed.\n\n      A player CAN, by announcement, petition a specified non-vacant\n      office to take a specific action. The holder of that office SHALL\n      publicly respond to that petition in a timely fashion.\n\nwith this text:\n\n      A person publishing a report SHALL do so in plain text, with\n      tabular data lining up properly when viewed in a monospaced font.\n      Publishing a report that deviates from these restrictions is the\n      Class 2 infraction of Making My Eyes Bleed.\n\n      A player CAN, by announcement, petition a specified person with a\n      specified duty to take a specific action related to that duty.\n      That person SHOULD publicly respond to that petition in a timely\n      fashion. A player CAN petition a specified non-vacant office in\n      the same fashion; its holder SHALL respond in the same fashion.\n\nAmend Rule 2694 (Hats) by replacing:\n\n      Unless otherwise specified by the rules: 1) the recordkeepor for\n      a player's hat is the player emself, and 2) reporting on hats is\n      OPTIONAL.\n\nwith:\n\n      The recordkeepor for a player's hat is the player emself. Rules\n      to the contrary notwithstanding, reporting on one's own hat is\n      OPTIONAL."
