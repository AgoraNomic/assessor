The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8928
Title: Acting on commitment
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: juan
Co-authors: 


Enact a rule with power=1.0 entitled "Acting on commitment" with text:

{
A Fingerprint for a document (the Plaintext) is a document that could
not have been reasonably created without knowledge of the Plaintext, and
which is related to the Plaintext in such a way that one could not
reasonably produce another document related to that Fingerprint in the
same way.

Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
commitment" to a particular kind of document, that person performs
that action by performing it by announcement while, in the same
message, also publishing a what is purportedly a Fingerprint for a
document of that kind.
}

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8929
Title: Tabled action security
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Murphy, snail


Amend Rule 2124 ("Performing Tabled Actions") by deleting the list item
containing "Cease to be a" and by inserting the following after the
first paragraph:

{

A supporter/objector to an intent, acting as emself, CAN by announcement
cease to be a supporter/objector ("withdraw" support/objection) of that
intent.

Limiting the ability to support or object to an intent is secured at the
power of the rule enabling that action to be performed.

}

Title: Rebalancing
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: nix
Co-authors: Murphy, snail


[Little buff to CFJs and nerf to Proposals, now that proposals have
become very common. Wording should work with current version or
Radiance.]

Amend R2657 by replacing:

     "Being the author of a proposal that takes effect: 5"

with:

     "Being the author of a proposal that takes effect: 4"

and replacing:

     "Judging a CFJ that e was assigned to without violating a time
limit to do so, unless at the time of judgement the case was open due to
self-filing a motion to reconsider it: 2"

with:

     "Judging a CFJ that e was assigned to without violating a time
limit to do so, unless at the time of judgement the case was open due to
self-filing a motion to reconsider it: 3"

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8932
Title: Only so bright
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2657 by replacing "Each time a player fulfills a radiance

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8933
Title: Ritual Ratification
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2680 by replacing "Declared ritual numbers are

that the ritual number was declared."
