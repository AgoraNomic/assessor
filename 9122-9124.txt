Title: Hats
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Mischief

Create a rule titled "Hats" reading:

Hats are a secured player switch defaulting to "none" with the following
possible values and associated meanings for the player's current focus:

       none: no particular focus

       armored helm: competing for wins and in sub-games

       dunce cap: expressing regret or acknowledging a mistake

       floral wreath: resolving conflict

       green eyeshade: maintaining accurate records

       hard hat: repairing problems in the rules

       jaunty beret: exploring creative expression

       jester's cap: bringing levity and humor

       judicial wig: ruling on CFJs and interpreting the rules

       knitted cap: finding loopholes and exploits

       plain hat: simplifying the rules

       rugged fedora: researching Agoran and Nomic history

       sleeping cap: reducing eir participation in Agora

       steampunk hat: creating new game mechanics

       traditional mortarboard: conducting research and writing theses

A player CAN change eir hat at any time by notifying the recordkeepor for
eir hat (publicly or privately). Unless otherwise specified by the rules:
1) the recordkeepor for a player's hat is the player emself, and 2)
reporting on hats is OPTIONAL.

Hats do not otherwise limit or restrict a player's actions in any way, and
every player is ENCOURAGED to participate in all aspects of the game
regardless of eir current hat.
