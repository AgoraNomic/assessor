The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8442
Title: Barrel Barrel Badger Barrel
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: 


Create a power-1 rule, "The General Store", with the following text:

  Barrels are a currency tracked by the Coopor (an office) in eir
  monthly report. A player CAN Corner the Market by paying a fee of
  100 barrels.  When a player corners the market, e wins the game.

  A bargain is a specification consisting of a title, a payout (a
  number of barrels between 1 and 10), and a tender (a list of 6 or
  more rules-defined card types; a type may be repeated, with each
  repeat being a separate element on the list).

  A player CAN cash out a specified bargain that's "on the barrel",
  by announcement, provided that, in the same message, e paid cards
  (possibly spread over multiple sets) to successfully earn rules-
  defined products, and those cards match all of the cards types in
  that bargain's tender.  The payment of a particular card instance
  can only match a single tender element for the single cashing out
  of a bargain.

  When a player cashes out a bargain on the barrel, e earns the
  payout for that bargain.

  The Coopor CANNOT cash out a specific bargain in the 14 days
  after putting that bargain on the barrel.


Create a power-1 rule, "Bargains on the Barrel", with the
following text:

  If there are fewer than four bargains on the barrel, the Coopor
  CAN put a bargain on the barrel with notice.  If there are fewer
  than eight bargains on the barrel, the Coopor CAN put a bargain on
  the barrel with 3 support.

  The Coopor CAN take a bargain off the barrel without N objections,
  where N is the number of months, rounded up, since that bargain
  was last placed on the barrel.  Within 14 days after winning an
  election for Coopor, the Coopor CAN take any bargain off the
  barrel with notice.

  The Coopor's monthly report includes a list of all bargains on the
  barrel.  E SHOULD publish such a list whenever e adds or removes a
  bargain from the barrel.


There are no bargains on the barrel.

G. is hereby made Coopor.

An election for Coopor is hereby initiated.

Title: Easier Retitling
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


[It's been bothering me for years that it takes a full proposal to fix
an incorrect title. This would simplify that in obvious cases, and is
pretty safe given that titles are non-substantive (while this
could interfere with a proposal, cleanings can already do
that.)]

Amend Rule 2221, "Cleanliness", by adding as a new paragraph:

  Any player CAN refile a rule without objection, specifying a new
  title; the rule is retitled to the specified title by this rule.

Retitle Rule 2221 to "Cleanliness and Tidy Filing"

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8446
Title: Victory Auctions
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: nch


If Proposal 8407 (no stinking auction definitions) has not taken
effect, the rest of this proposal has no effect.


Enact the following rule, Victory Auctions:

  The Treasuror CAN conduct an auction (a "victory auction") if no
  victory auction is ongoing.  The Treasuror MUST do so at least
  once a month, and SHOULD do so at least twice each month.

  A victory auction includes the following lots:

  * one new Victory Card.

  * all of any single type of card or product, currently owned by
    the Lost and Found Department, if any.

  The currency of a victory auction is coins (minimum bid 1).

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8448
Title: Populist Administration
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: Alexis, Falsifian


If a proposal titled "The Administrative State" has been adopted in the last
month, the remainder of this proposal has no effect.

Enact a new power 2.0 rule entitled "The Administrative State", with the
following text:

  Each officer CAN, with 1.5 Agoran consent, enact, amend, or repeal
  eir own office's Administrative Regulations. Administrative Regulations
  have the following properties:

  1. An officer SHALL abide by eir office's administrative regulations in
     the discharge of eir office.
  2. Any player CAN act on behalf of an officer to exercise eir official
     powers as authorized by eir office's administrative regulations.
  3. All players SHOULD abide by an officer's administrative regulations
     in matters relating to eir area of responsibility.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8449
Title: Simpler Heraldry
Adoption index: 1.5
Author: Aris
Co-authors: Alexis, Jason, Publius Scribonius Scholasticus


Amend Rule 649, "Patent Titles", by appending to the last paragraph:

  Any player CAN award a specified Patent Title to a specified player,
  as authorized by the Herald's Administrative Regulations.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8450
Title: CFJ extensions
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: G.
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 591 (Delivering Judgements) by appending the following
paragraph:

  If the judge of an open CFJ has not violated a time limit for
  assigning it a judgement, and has not previously filed a motion
  to either extend or reconsider the case, e CAN file a motion to
  extend the case by announcement. Doing so extends eir judgement
  deadline for that case by one week. In doing so, e SHOULD include
  a (nonbinding) draft or outline of eir current thoughts on the
  case.

[Self-filed motions to reconsider have been used a handful of times for
the above.  Might as well make it official, removes the Arbitor's
guesswork on when to reassign a late case.  Policy statement: the flip
side is that, as Arbitor I'd be more strict on reassignment deadlines
for people who are late without requesting the extension].

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8452
Title: Indictment Fixes
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Publius Scribonius Scholasticus
Co-authors: Jason, Trigon


Amend Rule 2619, "Indictment" by inserting "CAN and" prior to "SHALL initiate".

Amend Rule 2619, "Indictment" by inserting ", by announcement,"
following "the investigator CAN".

Amend Rule 2619, "Indictment" by appending the following sentence as a
new paragraph: "If it would be ILLEGAL or INEFFECTIVE for the
Investigator to levy a fine for the stated crime, all decisions
associated with the Indictment cease to exist, and the Judge and
Investigator are freed of any obligations of this rule."

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8453
Title: win indirection
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2553 (Win by Paradox) by replacing:

  that case's initiator CAN, by announcement, win the game.

with:

  that case's initiator, CAN, by announcement, Transcend Logic.  When
  a person transcends logic, e wins the game.


[This should make all wins in the rules indirect:  Ribbons,
Tournaments, and Apathy are indirect already]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8454
Title: Judicial non-person fixes
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: Jason, Publius Scribonius Scholasticus


Amend Rule 991 (Calls for Judgement) by replacing:
  When a CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
  eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
  in a timely fashion.
with:
  When an open CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
  eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
  in a timely fashion after it becomes an open and unassigned CFJ.

and by replacing:
  Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
  person or "unassigned" (default).
with:
  Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
  person or former person, or "unassigned" (default).


Every CFJ that had a former person as a judge immediately before Proposal
8134 took effect (02 Dec 2018) hereby has their judge switch flipped to
that judge.

[I'm really, really sure there's been no changes or attempted changes to
former persons' judgeship since Dec 2018, since all those cases were long
before that and I'd remember that].

If G. received any blots in the past two months as the result of failure
to assign a judge in a timely manner to any CFJ whose judge has been
changed by this proposal, that number of blots are expunged from em.

[Don't mind about 1 blot, this is mainly protection against "infinite"
blotting if it happens]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8455
Title: old judgements are good judgements
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: Jason, Publius Scribonius Scholasticus


Amend Rule 991 (Calls for Judgement) by replacing:
  At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
  assigned exactly one judgement.
with:
  At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
  assigned exactly one judgement that was validly assigned.

[Jason pointed out a while ago, that you could argue that when a judgement
option ceased to be defined (like UNDETERMINED has), it ceased to be a
judgement, so the case reverted to open.  Not sure if that's true, but
this makes sure the "validity when assigned" is what matters].
