//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8244
Title: Crime Cleanup
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors:

"Class 8 Crime".

  that evaluates to a positive integer)

Amend Rule 2589 by replacing the text "Class-3 Crime" with the text

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8245
Title: Pool drain timing
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 1607 (Distribution) by replacing:
      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as part of eir weekly
      duties, distribute all proposals in the Proposal Pool except for
      those exempted from automatic distribution by other rules.
with:
      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL distribute each
      proposal that was in the Proposal Pool at the beginning of that
      week, except for those excepted from automatic distribution
      by other rules, or those that are otherwise removed from the
      Pool.

[This way, the "act of deputization" can be any single proposal
that was in the pool at the beginning of the week.  Further,
for proposals inserted in a week, the promotor has the option
of either distributing them that week or leaving them for the
next week, so Aris's "please don't make any changes until
I distribute" emails are less needed, and e can time stuff.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8246
Title: Tracking of Master
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Jason

Amend Rule 2532 ("Zombies") by replacing the sentence beginning "Master

[This isn't currently made explicit at the definition of Master, but is
required by the last paragraph of Rule 2139.]
