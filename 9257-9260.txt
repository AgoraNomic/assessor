Title: paragraph swap
Adoption index: 3.0

Amend Rule 2201 ("Self-Ratification") by replacing

{
Any person CAN by announcement issue a doubt (syn. claim of
error), identifying a public document published less than 180 days
ago and explaining the scope and nature of a perceived error in it
(or in a statement it attests to).
       The definition of documents as self-ratifying and the definition
of documents as self-ratifying attestations are secured at power
3.
}
with
{
The definition of documents as self-ratifying and the definition
of documents as self-ratifying attestations are secured at power
3.

Any person CAN by announcement issue a doubt (syn. claim of
error), identifying a public document published less than 180 days
ago and explaining the scope and nature of a perceived error in it
(or in a statement it attests to).
}

[The last paragraph begins with "When this happens, ...", which due to
the current order of the paragraphs makes it sound like the actions
described in it need to be done when the definitions are secured, not
when a doubt is issued.]

Title: A reasonable limit
Adoption index: 1.0

Amend Rule 2707 ("Pyrite") by replacing "A player CAN pay a fee of 200
Pyrite to gain 1 Spendie." with "A player CAN pay a fee of 200 Pyrite to
gain 1 Spendie, provided that e has gained fewer than 40 Spendies in
this way during this Agoran month."

[Put a hard cap at 3x normal on spendies per month to prevent
Agoriculture from completely dominating the game.]
