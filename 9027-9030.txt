//comment: Changes "points" to "Radiance"

Amend Rule 2675 (Dream of Wandering) to read, in full:

{

      The Dream Keeper is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of the dreams of all active players.

      Dream is a secured active player switch, tracked by the Dream
      Keeper in eir weekly report, with possible values any Dream,
      defaulting to Wandering. An "X Dreamer" is a player with eir Dream
      switch set to X.

      An active player CAN "envision" eir own Dream, specifying any
      valid value for eir Dream, by announcement. When the rules state
      that the wandering occurs, every active player's Dream is set to
      the value e most recently envisioned. If a player did not envision
      a dream since the last wandering, it is not flipped.

      A wandering occurs at the beginning of each week.

      The following is an exhaustive list of all Dreams and the rules
      relevant to each dream:

      - Wandering: This dream has no effect.

      - Charity: Immediately after a wandering, one stamp (chosen by
        most-to-least owned by the L&FD at time of transfer, tie-broken
        alphabetically) is transferred to each Charity Dreamer (in order
        from least-to-most stamps owned, tie-broken alphabetically) from
        the L&FD. If the number of Stamps the L&FD owned during the last
        wandering is greater than 10, this process happens a second
        time. If it is more than 20, this process happens a third time.

      - Justice: Immediately after a wandering, 1 blot is expunged from
        each Justice Dreamer. If a Justice Dreamer had no blots
        immediately after a wandering, e CAN once expunge one blot, by
        announcement, from a specified player before the next wandering.

      - Sharing: Immediately after a wandering, each Sharing Dreamer has
        eir Radiance increased by X / Y, rounded down, where X is half the
        number of active players, rounded up, and Y is the number of
        Sharing Dreamers.

      - Wealth: Immediately after a wandering, X stamps of eir own type
        are granted to each Wealth Dreamer. When less than 8 Stamps of
        eir type exist, X is 2. When 8 to 15 Stamps of eir type exist, X
        is 1. When 16 ore more Stamps of eir type exist, X is 0.

      - Gardens: Immediately after a wandering, the Base Rockiness of
        each Gardens Dreamer is increased by 1.

      - Power: Each Power Dreamer has eir voting strength increased by 2
        for referenda on ordinary proposals.

      - Revolution: A revolution is happening if the majority of active
        players are Revolution Dreamers. Immediately after a wandering,
        if a revolution is not happening, then all Revolution Dreamers
        have eir radiance decreased by 1 to a minimum of 0. Immediately
        after a wandering, if a revolution is happening, then all
        players have eir radiance set to 100-X, where X was eir radiance
        when the wandering occurred, and all player's Dreams are set to
        Wandering.
