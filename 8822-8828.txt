Race Place is a Horse switch with possible values of first, second, third,
and none (default), tracked by the Horsened.

A horse is Running if it has a Race Place of none.

When the race starts anew, each horse's Race Position is set to 0, each
horse's Race Place is set to none, all horses are transfered to Agora, all
dollaries and hooves are destroyed, and each player receives 10 dollaries.

}


Enact a new rule with title "The Horses Run" and the following text:

{

The horses Run at the start of each week, unless the horses were not
motivated within the last week.

When the horses run, each player gains 1 hoof, movement resolves, and then
if any horses have a Race Position of 16 and a Race Place of none, those
horses cross the finish line in alphabetical order of their names.

When a horse crosses the finish line:

* If no horse has a Race Place of first, the horse's Race Place is set to
first.

* Otherwise, if no horse has a Race Place of second, the horse's Race Place
is set to second.

* Otherwise, the horse's Race Place is set to third and the race ends, and
no horse can cross the finish line until the horses are next motivated.

}


Enact a new rule with title "Horse Victory" and the following text:

dollaries.

* the player that owns the horse with a Race Place of second gains 30
dollaries.

* the player that owns the horse with a Race Place of third gains 15
dollaries.

* For each horse, each player that got both a jersey and a helmet for that
horse since the last time the race started anew gains 5 dollaries.

* For each horse, each player gains a number of dollaries equal to that
horse's current multiplier * the number of dollaries e bet on that horse
since the last time the race started anew.

* The score of the player that has the most dollaries is increased by 15.
In the event of a tie, instead, no score change occurs.

* The race starts anew.

}

A horse's current multiplier is based on the following chart:

1, 2, 3: The horse's Race Place is first, second, or third, respectively.
