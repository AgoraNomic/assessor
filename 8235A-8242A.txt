  shorthand for this method with N = 1);

  3. with N Agoran consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1 with
  a minimum of 1 ("With Agoran consent" is shorthand for this method
  with N = 1);

  N is 1 unless otherwise specified.

Title: The Editor (v2.0.1)
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: G., Aris, Trigon


[Comment: Creates a new role, the Editor, who is the same person as the
Rulekeepor and which is responsible for promulgating regulations
(Editorial Guidelines) about non-substantive elements of the Ruleset.
Currently, guidelines are not written down anywhere official, which
probably contributes to the inconsistency arising in the first place.]

Enact a new Rule with power 1, title "The Editor", and text as follows:

  The Editor is the same person, if any, as the Rulekeepor.

  The Editor CAN, with Agoran consent, enact regulations, collectively
  called "Editorial Guidelines". The Editor CAN, with Agoran consent,
  repeal and amend Editorial Guidelines. The Editor is the Promulgator
  for all Editorial Guidelines.

  Editorial Guidelines SHOULD pertain only to matters that affect
  non-substantive aspects of the Rules, e.g. capitalization or
  spelling. Editorial Guidelines CANNOT place any enforceable
  requirements upon any player and CANNOT cause any changes to the
  gamestate. Whether or not the text of a textual entity conforms to
  the Editorial Guidelines SHOULD NOT affect the interpretation of
  that entity.

  When writing proposals and enacting or amending regulations, players
  SHOULD follow all reasonable directives that are set out in the
  Editorial Guidelines.

  Causing an Editorial Guideline to be inconsistent with any other
  Editorial Guideline is the Class 1 Crime of Editorial Hypocrisy.

Title: Regulation clarification
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet

[Comment: Currently, R2493 reads as if any person who happens to be
Promulgator can enact/amend/repeal _any_ regulation (without otherwise
specified rules) with 2 Agoran Consent. While not the most serious bug,
it's probably not what was intended.]

Amend Rule 2493 ("Regulations") as follows:

  Replace the sentence beginning "By default" with the sentence
    By default, a person CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, enact, amend,
    or repeal a regulation for which e is the Promulgator.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8241
Title: Secured switches (v2.0)
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Falsifian


[Comment: define what it means for switches to be "secured", then use
that definition. This works with default power thresholds since it isn't
R2162 that designates the changes as secured, the Rule that defines the
switch is defined as designating the changes as secured.]

Amend Rule 2162 by appending the following sentence to the paragraph
beginning "At any given time":

  A Rule that designates a switch as "secured" (at a given power
  level) designates changes to the properties of that type of switch
  as secured (at that power level) and designates changes to the value
  of each instance of the switch as secured (at that power level).

Amend Rule 1950 as follows:

  Delete the text "Adoption index is secured with a power threshold of
  2.".

  Replace the text

    Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
    decisions and proposals.

  with the text

    Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
    decisions and proposals, secured at power 2.

Amend Rule 2480 as follows:

  Delete the text "Changes to Festivity are secured.".

  Replace the text "Festivity is a singleton switch" with the text
  "Festivity is a secured singleton switch".

Amend Rule 869 as follows:

  Delete the text "Changes to citizenship are secured.".

  Replace the text "Citizenship is a person switch" with the text
  "Citizenship is a secured person switch".

Amend Rule 478 as follows:

  Delete the text "Changes to publicity are secured.".

  Replace the text "Publicity is a forum switch" with the text
  "Publicity is a secured forum switch.".

Title: Let the dead rest
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Falsifian
Co-authors: 


If Hālian is a zombie, then deregister em.
[Comment: eir resale value was 0 before R. Lee deregistered, so e was
due to be deregistered.]

Append the following sentence to the end of the first paragraph of
Rule 2532 (Zombies):

  When a zombie's master ceases to be a player, the value of the zombie's
  master switch is set to Agora.
