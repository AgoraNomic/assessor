[This gives everyone a bit of warning before someone goes and repeals the
Emergency Regulations, and gives the PM time to potentially extend
the emergency. Note that explicitly specifying the deadline in this rule
means that it can't be extended further.]

Amend the rule entitled "Eclipse Light" by changing the text
  "by announcement"
to read
  "with 7 days notice".

Amend Rule 2143, "Official Reports and Duties", by changing the final

in a timely fashion.
