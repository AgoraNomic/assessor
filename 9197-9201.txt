Title: The Game is Afoot
Adoption index: 1.5
Author: Mischief

[Maybe this could be a way to spur some more gameplay.

The underlying idea:
Spendies -> candles (contest subgames) -> radiance

Players can still buy radiance directly, they still get a universal
basic income in spendies, etc.

Candles are a shelf-stable form of radiance but can only be held by
contests. 1 spendie grants 1 candle; 1 candle grants 1 radiance.

Under this model, Bang! could be reconstituted as a contest if folks
wished.]


Create a rule entitled "Contests" with power 1.5 reading:

       Contestation is a secured negative boolean contract switch
       tracked by the Notary. A contract whose contestation switch is
       true is a contest.

       A player CAN flip a specified contract's contestation to true
       without 2 objections.

       A player CAN flip a specified contract's contestation to false
       with Agoran consent.


Create a rule entitled "Candles" with power 1.5 reading:

       Candles are fixed fungible assets tracked by the Illuminator.

       Contests are the only entities permitted to own candles, and any
       candles held by any other entity are immediately destroyed.

       A player CAN pay a fee of 1 spendie to grant 1 candle to a
       contest.

       As explicitly and unambiguously permitted by a contest's body, a
       party to that contest CAN bestow a prize by an announcement
       clearly identifying the recipient player, the amount of radiance
       to award (N), and the relevant contest. Upon doing so, if the
       specified contest possesses at least N candles the following
       happen in order: N of its candles are destroyed, then the
       specified player gains N radiance.

Title: Rare Stamps, Differently
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Mischief

[This is a different approach than I took with the June proposal. Rare
stamps just seem like too good of a concept to not do *something* with
them. For what it's worth, as of the submission of this proposal no
player is eligible to claim the title (several folks are tied).]

Create a rule entitled "Stamp Scamp" reading:

       A rare stamp is a stamp that is the only one of its type that
       exists.

       Upon a correct announcement that a specified player owns more
       rare stamps than any other player, the following happen in order:

         1) that player is awarded the patent title Stamp Scamp if e
         does not already hold it

         2) the patent title Stamp Scamp is revoked from any other
         person holding it

       Once per quarter a player holding the Stamp Scamp patent title
       CAN, by announcement, cause another specified player to gain one
       stamp of that specified player's type.

Amend rule 2659 (Stamps) by replacing:

       Any player CAN, once per week, pay X Stamps, where each specified
       Stamp is a different type, to gain (X^2)-X radiance.

with:

       Any player CAN, once per week, pay X stamps, where each specified
       stamp is a different type, to gain (X-1)*3 radiance.

Title: Vox Populi > Vox Fortunae
Adoption index: 1.5
Author: snail

[Spendies drive a number of game mechanics, and radiance drives wins.

This proposal explicitly terminates any ongoing sortition for either
office; R2691 probably does that too, but this is extra assurance.]


Any ongoing sortition for the office of Illuminator or the office of
Spendor immediately ends with no selection; any duty to select an option
with respect to such a sortition is discharged.

Amend rule 2656 (Radiance) by replacing "a sortitioned" with "an"

Amend rule 2690 (Spendies) by replacing "a sortitioned" with "an"
