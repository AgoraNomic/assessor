ID: 9154
Title: Pragmatic quarters, take two
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: Mischief


Amend Rule 2555 (Blots) by replacing this text:

        At the beginning of each quarter, half (rounded down) of each
        fugitive's blots are destroyed.

with this text:

        Once a quarter, the Referee CAN (and SHALL during its first
        Eastman week) publish a Notice of Clemency, upon which half
        (rounded down) of each fugitive's blots are destroyed.

Amend Rule 2685 (Crystals) by replacing this text:

        At the beginning of each quarter, each crystal whose identity is
        not equal to the ID of any rule in the current ruleset has its
        size increased by 3.

with this text:

        Once a quarter, the Geologist CAN (and SHALL during its first
        Eastman week) publish a Notice of Crystal Growth, upon which each
        crystal whose identity is not equal to the ID of any rule in the
        current ruleset has its size increased by 3.

Amend Rule 2656 (Radiance) by replacing this text:

        At the start of every quarter, all radiance switches are set to
        half their current value rounded down.

with this text:

        Once a quarter, the Illuminator CAN (and SHALL during its first
        Eastman week) publish a Notice of Diminution, upon which all
        radiance switches are set to half their current value rounded
        down.

[Same as before, except the officer is required to do it within the
  first seven days of the quarter. If e's late, then the timing still
  differs, but that may still be better than a platonic event occurring
  but potentially being overlooked.]
