//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8852
Title: Fix infractions
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: 4st
Co-authors: Janet


Amend rule 2555 "Blots" by replacing the following sentence:
"Destroying blots is secured with a Power Threshold of 1.7."
with
"Creating and destroying blots is secured with a Power Threshold of 1.7"

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8853
Title: Unfortunately
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 869 by appending the following paragraphs:
{
Banned is a secured negative boolean person switch tracked by the
Registrar. A person is unwelcome if e is Banned or if at least one part
of em is unwelcome. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an unwelcome
person CANNOT register or be registered, and e is immediately
deregistered if e is ever a player. Designations of unwelcomeness are
secured.

Unwelcomeness is to be used only to make a social statement that the
Agoran community no longer wishes to interact with certain persons; in
particular, it is not to be used to acquire gameplay advantage. As such,
an unwelcome person SHOULD NOT, under any circumstances, attempt to
bypass unwelcomeness, and e SHOULD carefully consider the circumstances
of eir becoming unwelcome before participating in public or discussion fora.
}

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8854
Title: Attainder
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


For the purposes of this proposal, "Madrid" is the person who, at the
time of this proposal's submission, was a player and who was known as
"Madrid" to the average Agoran.

Madrid is hereby deregistered.
Madrid's instance of the Banned switch is hereby flipped to true.

[
This is a bill of attainder. Its purpose is to deregister and, if
possible, ban Madrid as a sanction for a series of incidents on the
lists and on the unofficial Discord server. This is not in response to
any single incident, but rather a pattern of behavior. This is
additionally not in response to Madrid's distaste for Spivak pronouns
itself, regardless of the timing of this submission.

Madrid's actions and views have resulted in two deregistrations (one
successful FAGE and one attempted FAGE that wasn't a FAGE due to a
technicality), hostile exchanges of words on list, and an atmosphere on
the Discord that discourages participation in discussion. No other
single player's non-gameplay actions and expressions of views have
resulting in similar responses from other players.

This proposal is phrased in such a way that, if adopted, Madrid will be
unconditionally deregisted and will be Banned if the associated proposal
"Unfortunately" has been adopted. Even if "Unfortunately" has not been
adopted, the adoption of this proposal represents the AI-3 consensus
that Madrid is not welcome. If this occurs, and "Unfortunately" failed
due to a technical reason rather than apparent rejection of the idea,
the author will pursue further proposals to officialize the ban.
