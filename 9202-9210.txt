The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 9202
Title: Track Assets
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2692 (Bang!) by replacing "Bangs are a fungible asset." with
"Bangs are an untracked fungible asset."

Retitle Rule 2603 (Switch Responsibility) to "Default Recordkeepors",
and amend it by replacing "switch" with "switch or asset".

[Unchanged from proto. Encourages assets intended to be untracked to be
  explicitly labeled as such, otherwise materializes an officer, both in
  the same fashion as switches.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Title: A clarification
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: ais523


Amend Rule 991 ("Calls for Judgement") by appending the following to the
first paragraph: "A case so initiated is an inquiry case."

["inquiry case" is a historical term used for a CFJ on the truth of a
statement. It has a few remaining uses in the rules. Defining it here
removes any ambiguity and helps answer a question that has been asked
multiple times by newer players. This is careful to not redefine "CFJ"
itself, which might affect past CFJs.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 9204
Title: Rare stamps, more differently
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2701 ("Stamp Scamp") to read, in whole:

{

A rare stamp is a stamp that is the only one of its type that exists.

Stamp scamp is a singleton switch tracked by the Collector with possible
values of each player and null (default). Upon a correct announcement
that a specified player owns more rare stamps than any other player, the
stamp scamp switch is flipped to that player.

If no person has done so by this mechanism in this quarter, the value of
the stamp scamp switch, if a player, CAN by announcement cause another
specified player to gain one stamp of that player's type.

}

If exactly one player holds the patent title of Stamp Scamp, the stamp
scamp switch is hereby flipped to that player.

The patent title "Stamp Scamp" is hereby revoked from each player that
holds it.

[Switches are the standard way to track state like this. We shouldn't
use a patent title for this. The current Herald is not actually
reporting, so it will not actually be tracked; the Herald's report
should be used for historical matters, not (new) ephemera; and it will
hand out violet ribbons for very little reason.]

Title: Switch It Up
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Mischief
Co-authors: Janet


[This explicitly allow contracts to define switches. They maybe work
okay anyway, but this puts things on a firmer foundation. The "secured"
definition is deliberately left referencing Rules only, as a contract
doesn't have power.

I considered amending the third paragraph of rule 2698 (Recordkeepors),
but contracts have plenty of flexibility to impose any desired reporting
requirements for their switches (or to leave them untracked).]

Amend rule 2162 (Switches) by making the following replacements, in order:

1) Replace:

       A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a switch,
       and specify the following:

    with:

       A type of switch is a property that a rule or a contract defines
       as a switch (with such rule or contract being its backing
       document) and specifies the following:

2) Replace:

       If a type of switch is not explicitly designated as
       possibly-indeterminate by the rule that defines it, and if an
       action or set of actions would cause the value of an instance of
       that type of switch to become indeterminate, that instance instead
       takes on its last determinate and possible value, if any,
       otherwise it takes on its default value.

    with:

       If a type of switch is not explicitly designated as
       possibly-indeterminate by its backing document, and if an action
       or set of actions would cause the value of an instance of that
       type of switch to become indeterminate, that instance instead
       takes on its last determinate and possible value, if any,
       otherwise it takes on its default value.

Title: Let Contracts Own Stamps
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Mischief
Co-authors: 


Amend rule 2659 (Stamps) by replacing:

       Stamps are a category of asset ownable by players.

with:

       Stamps are a category of asset ownable by players and contracts.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 9208
Title: Destroy the Office
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: 4st
Co-authors: 


Amend Crystals (Rule 2685) by replacing:
"The Geologist is a sortitioned office that tracks crystals."
with:
"Crystals are untracked."
and replacing:
"Once a quarter, the Geologist CAN (and SHALL during its first
      Eastman week) publish a Notice of Crystal Growth, upon which each
      crystal whose identity is not equal to the ID of any rule in the
      current ruleset has its size increased by 3."
with:
"At the beginning of each quarter, all crystals whose identity is not equal
to the ID of any rule in the current ruleset has its size increased by 3."

If this proposal is democratic, repeal Crystals (Rule 2685).
