[I fixed the problems pointed out with the last version. I also added an
A.N.A. degree (I hadn't done so previously, because I thought it was
unnecessary, but exceptions are messy). I rephrased and reordered some things
too.]

Amend Rule 1367, "Degrees", by changing it to read as follows:

Certain patent titles are known as degrees. The degrees are

  - Associate of Nomic Artistry        (A.N.A.)
  - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
  - Juris Doctorate of Nomic           (J.N.)
  - Baccalaureate of Nomic Artistry    (B.N.A.)
  - Baccalaureate of Nomic             (B.N.)
  - Magisteriate of Nomic Artistry     (M.N.A)
  - Magisteriate of Nomic              (M.N.)
  - Doctorate of Nomic Artistry        (D.N.Art.)
  - Doctorate of Nomic History         (D.N.Hist.)
  - Doctorate of Nomic Law             (D.N.Law.)
  - Doctorate of Nomic Science         (D.N.Sci.)
  - Doctorate of Nomic Philosophy      (D.N.Phil.)

  There are four classes of degrees, ranked in ascending order of merit:
  Associate degrees (A.N.A. and A.N.), Baccalaureate degrees
  (J.N through B.N.), Magisteriate degrees (M.N.A and M.N), and
  Doctorate degrees (D.N.Art. through D.N.Phil.).

  A specified degree CAN be awarded by any player other than the
  awardee, with 2 Agoran consent. It SHOULD only be awarded for the
  publication of an original thesis of scholarly worth (including
  responses to peer-review), published with explicit intent to
  qualify for a degree. The Herald SHOULD coordinate the peer-review
  process and the awarding of degrees.

  Degrees SHOULD be awarded according to the extent to which the thesis
  contributes to Nomic culture or thought: Associate degrees for an
  appreciable contribution, Baccalaureate degrees for a substantial
  contribution, Magisteriate degrees for a remarkable contribution, and
  Doctorate degrees for an exceptional contribution. Any degree at the
  Doctorate level SHOULD take into account the awardee's academic history
  and participation in Agora over time.

  Theses for Artistry degrees SHOULD demonstrate substantial creativity
  and need not be in written form. Theses for all other degrees SHOULD
  demonstrate substantial research or analysis. J.N. and D.N.Law are
  appropriate for high-quality legal analysis, of the sort typical to CFJs,
  but exceeding an ordinary CFJ in depth. The D.N.Hist. degree is
  appropriate for historical research, especially when it presents a
  narrative that educates Agorans about the events of the past. The D.N.Sci.
  degree is appropriate for theses that demonstrate concrete or scientific
  thinking, whereas the D.N.Phil. is appropriate for theses that demonstrate
  abstract or philosophical thinking.

Rename every instance of the first listed patent title on each row to the
second listed patent title on each row:

- Juris Doctor of Nomic, Juris Doctorate of Nomic
- Doctor of Nomic History, Doctorate of Nomic History
- Doctor of Nomic Law, Doctorate of Nomic Law
- Doctor of Nomic Science, Doctorate of Nomic Science
- Doctor of Nomic Philosophy, Doctorate of Nomic Philosophy

Title: Promise Powers Patch
Adoption index: 2.2
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


[There was a bug in my original version (in the sense of it doing something
other than what I intended); I solved the problem of people acting on behalf of
their zombies to enter promises by putting an "acting as emself" requirement,
forgetting that this also affected contracts and stopped promises from
creating other promises. This proposal remedies my error.]

Amend the rule entitled "Promises" by deleting the text "acting as emself, ".

Amend Rule 2532, "Zombies", by changing the text

  "- enter a contract, pledge, or other type of agreement"

to read

  "- enter a contract, pledge, promise, or other type of agreement"

Amend Rule 2581 "Official Patent Titles" by appending the following
list item at the end of the list items but before the last paragraph
  {- Terms of Service, awardable by the Notary to any player who creates
  multiple Contracts that achieve fun gameplay and significantly impacts
  Agora as a whole}

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Title: Small Pledge Amendments
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: R. Lee
Co-authors: 


Amend rule 2450 "Pledges" by inserting the following sentence after
the words "explicitly states otherwise":
  {It is also Oathbreaking for a player to let a pledge expire without taking
  an action e pledged to do in that pledge.}

  Also amend the same rule by replacing the text
  {and should do so if and only if the pledge no longer serves any
  significant purpose.}
  with the new text
  {but SHOULD NOT do so unless the pledge no longer serves any significant
  purpose.}

  [Nonbinding comment: The first one is a very common type of pledge but I'm
  worried that they are unenforceable. This does not extend the time limit
  forever because it is a crime for the pledge to expire and there is a
  universal 14-day statute of limitations from that point. The second
  amendment is just to capitalize something that should be capitalised and
  make the sentence a bit better]

Title: Why Track Pendency?
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


[Currently, Sets would make me track proposals forever. The simplest
fix is just to make the Pended switch untracked. It'll end up getting
effectively tracked anyway, since it determines whether a proposal must
be distributed.]

Amend the rule entitled "Pending Proposals" by changing the text "Pended is a
negative boolean proposal switch tracked by the Promotor." to read
"Pended is an untracked negative boolean proposal switch."

Title: Proposal Recycling Initiative
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


[This helps for any proposals that either were distributed before the new
regime and failed quorum, or any proposals that are accidentally distributed
and failed quorum. While I'm at it, there's no reason this needs to be at
power 3.0.]

Amend Rule 2350, "Proposals", by deleting the text:
  If a decision of whether to adopt a proposal was resolved as
  FAILED QUORUM in the last seven days, the Promotor CAN once add
  the proposal back to the Proposal Pool by announcement.

Enact a new rule entitled "Proposal Recycling", with the following text:

  If a decision of whether to adopt a proposal was resolved as
  FAILED QUORUM in the last seven days, the Promotor CAN once recycle
  the proposal by announcement, adding it to the Proposal Pool and causing
  it to become pended.

Title: Identity theft protection act v1.1

Author: Falsifian
Co-authors: G., Publius Scribonius Scholasticus


Amend Rule 2141 by replacing the text

  Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.

with

  Every rule shall have an ID number, distinct among current and
  former rules, to be assigned once by the Rulekeepor.

[Comment: this version is designed to prevent the Rulekeepor from
assigning the same ID to two rules in addition to the protection
against changing IDs.]

Title: Properly Prioritized Popular Proposal Proposer Privilege
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: G.


[I've gone with making this an "honest" popularity system, not affected
by manipulatable mechanics such as proposal strength.]

Amend the rule entitled "Popular Proposal Proposer Privilege"
by changing it to read in full:

  For an Agoran decision on whether to adopt a proposal, let F be the total
  number of valid ballots resolving to FOR, A be the same for AGAINST,
  and T be the total number of valid ballots. The decision's popularity
  is equal to (F - A)/T. The Assessor SHOULD publish the popularity of each
  decision when resolving it.


  The player who proposed the adopted proposal such that the decision on whether
  to adopt it had the greatest popularity, among all such decisions assessed in
  the last 7 days CAN once earn one Legislative Card by announcement, provided
  that no decision on whether to adopt any proposal distributed in the same
  message remains unresolved. If there is a tie, all authors of the tied
  proposals can do so once each.

Title: Referenda
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 1607, "Distribution", by replacing:

  Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision. For
  this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the adoption
  index is initially the adoption index of the proposal, or 1.0 if
  the proposal does not have one, and the text, author, coauthors,
  class and (if applicable) chamber of the proposal are essential
  parameters. Initiating such a decision is known as distribution,
  and removes the proposal from the Proposal Pool.

with:

  A referendum is the Agoran decision to determine whether to adopt a proposal.
  For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the adoption index is
  initially the adoption index of the proposal, or 1.0 if the proposal does not
  have one, and the text, author, coauthors, class and (if applicable) chamber
  of the proposal are essential parameters. Initiating a referendum is known
  as distribution, and removes the proposal from the Proposal Pool.

Amend Rule 2606, "Proposal Classes", by changing the text "Agoran decision on
its adoption" to read "referendum on it".

Amend Rule 2607, "Proposal Chambers", by changing the text "Agoran decision on
its adoption" to read "referendum on it".

Amend Rule 106, "Adopting Proposals", by changing the text "a decision about
whether to adopt a proposal" to read "a referendum on a proposal".

Amend Rule 879, "Quorum", by changing the text "the Agoran decision on whether
to adopt a proposal" to read "the referendum".

Amend Rule 2168, "Extending the voting period", by changing the text
"whether to adopt a proposal" to read "a referendum on a proposal".

Amend Rule 2496, Rewards, by changing the text "FOR the decision" to read
"FOR the referendum" and replacing:
  Resolving an Agoran Decision on whether to adopt a proposal,
  provided that no other Agoran Decision on whether to adopt that
  or any other proposal had been resolved earlier in that Agoran
  week: 5 coins (ADoP).
with:
  Resolving a referendum, provided that no other referendum had been resolved
  earlier in that Agoran week: 5 coins (ADoP).

Amend Rule 2438, "Ribbons", by changing the text "an Agoran Decision" to
read "a referendum".

If the proposal entitled "Properly Prioritized Popular Proposal Proposer
Privilege" has passed:
  Amend the Rule entitled "Popular Proposal Proposer Privilege" by changing it
  to read in full:
    For a referendum, let F be the total number of valid ballots resolving to
    FOR, A be the same for AGAINST, and T be the total number of valid ballots.
    The referendum's popularity is equal to (F - A)/T. The Assessor SHOULD
    publish the popularity of each referendum when resolving it.

    The player who proposed the adopted proposal whose referendum had
    the greatest popularity among all referenda assessed in the last 7 days CAN
    once earn one Legislative Card by announcement, provided that no referendum
    initiated in the same message as it remains unresolved. If there is a tie,
    all authors of the tied proposals can do so once each.
Otherwise:
  Amend the rule entitled "Popular Proposal Proposer Privilege" by
  changing the text "provided that no decision on whether to adopt any proposal
  distributed in the same message remains open." to read "provided that
  no referendum initiated in the same message remains open."

[Note: One of these will fail.]

Amend Rule 2350, "Proposals", by changing the text "If a decision of whether to
adopt a proposal was resolved as FAILED QUORUM in the last seven days"
to read "If a referendum on a proposal was resolved as FAILED QUORUM in the
last seven days".

Title: Certifiable Patches
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: nix, Publius Scribonius Scholasticus


[This may be over-clear, but should be CFJ proof.]

Enact a new power 1.0 rule, entitled "Certifiable Patches", with the following
text:
  Any player CAN, by announcement, certify a specified proposal (as a patch),
  causing it to become pending.

  A player SHALL NOT certify a proposal unless its sole function is to
  minimally rectify a bug, error, or ambiguity (a problem) that relates
  to a) an office e holds; or b) a CFJ, open within the last week, of which
  e is the judge. Certifying a proposal in violation of this paragraph
  is the Class-4 Crime of Uncertain Certification. A player certifying a
  proposal SHOULD explain why doing so does not violate this paragraph.

  For the purposes of this rule:

  1. A bug is a situation in which a rule operates in a way that is clearly
     contrary to legislative intent or common sense.
  2. An error is a change introduced by apparent mistake, such as the
     self-ratification of an incorrect report or a typo in a rule amendment.
  3. An ambiguity is a state of affairs in which reasonable players could
     disagree about the operation of the rules or the state of a rule defined
     property.
  4. A minimal rectification is one that resolves the problem without doing
     substantially more than is necessary to resolve it. For instance,
     rectification that uses more slightly words than necessary to resolve the
     problem may still be minimal, whereas a rectification that makes rule
     changes unrelated to fixing the problem would not be.
  5. A problem relates to an office if it plausibly affects the area of
     the game the office is responsible for and relates to a CFJ if it
     could plausibly be interpreted to affect that CFJ's outcome.
