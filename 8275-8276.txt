Adoption index: 3.0

Amend Rule 478 ("Fora") by replacing the text

  Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
  announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously and
  clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs it.

with the text

Title: Various Election Fixes v2
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2154 ("Election Procedure") by replacing the text "declare em
the winner of the election by announcement" with the text "by
announcement declare em the winner of the election, thereby causing em
to win the election".

[This clarifies that this actually causes the person to win the
election, which could be construed as a distinct action from "declaring
em the winner". The replaced text differs from the one in the most
recent SLR because Falsifian cleaned the text by replacing "them" with
"em" since then.]

Amend Rule 2154 ("Election Procedure") by replacing the text "In a
timely fashion after the nomination period ends, the ADoP CAN and SHALL"
with the text "After the nomination period ends, the ADoP CAN and, in a
timely fashion, SHALL".

[Ensures that the ADoP doesn't lose the ability to initiate an Agoran
Decision for an election after a week passes.]
