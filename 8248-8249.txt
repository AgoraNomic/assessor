//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8248
Title: Publishing definition
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: Aris


Amend Rule 478 ("Fora") by replacing the text

  A person "publishes" or "announces" something by sending a public
  message.

with the text

  To "publish" or "announce" something is to send a public message
  whose body contains that thing.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8249
Title: No Harm No Foul
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Jacob Arduino
Co-authors: twg


Amend rule 2143, "Official Reports and Duties", by removing
the paragraph starting "A person SHALL NOT publish information
that is inaccurate or misleading".

[This clause is duplicated by No Faking, except that it also
illegalises _accidentally_ publishing an inaccurate report,
or deliberately and obviously publishing an inaccurate report
for the public good, both of which I think ought to be
allowed.]
