Amend Rule 2643 "Collecting Stones" by replacing the final paragraph
with the following:
{

  A collection notice includes zero or more random choices of whether each
  stone escapes. Each choice results in escape with probability equal to
  its escape risk; a stone escapes if any choice selects escape. When a
  collection notice is published, stones that escape are transferred to
  Agora in an order specified by the collection notice.

  If a stone is immune, there are zero escape choices; otherwise, there is
  one choice if the stone was used in the previous Agoran month, or two if
  it was not.

  When a player takes over the economy, e wins the game. If a player Took
  Over the Economy 4 days ago, all Cards and all Products are destroyed,
  then each active player is granted 1 card of each type.
