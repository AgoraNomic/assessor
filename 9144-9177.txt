Title: Sortition, again
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


If at least one of the following conditions would be met prior to the
amendment, amend Rule 2691 ("Sortition Procedure") by, as a single
amendment:

* If the Rule contains a paragraph beginning "At the beginning of each
quarter", replacing that paragraph with the following paragraphs:

{

A player CAN by announcement initiate a sortition for a vacant
sortitioned office for which a sortition is not ongoing. At the
beginning of each quarter, for each sortitioned office for which a
sortition is not ongoing, the ADoP CAN once by announcement, and SHALL
in a timely fashion, initiate a sortition.

Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a sortition CANNOT be initiated
for an office for which a sortition is ongoing.

}

* If the Rule does not contain a single paragraph beginning "If a
sortition is ever ongoing", appending the following paragraph:

{

If a sortition is ever ongoing for a non-sortitioned office (or for an
office that no longer exists), that sortition immediately ends.

}

The publicity of the forum that can be sent to at the email address
agora-talk@agora.nomic.space is hereby flipped to Discussion.

[In light of omd saying e would prefer someone else to take over
maintenance of the lists, in addition to what appears to be a current
list outage, let's at least start trying a mailing list that is hosted
by someone else.]

Title: Paradox cleanup fix
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: ais523

Add a new paragraph to the end of rule 991:
{{{
      If two CFJs become assigned to the same judge in the same
      message, those CFJs are "linked" to each other, unless that
      message specifies that the CFJs should not be linked. The
      Arbitor SHOULD consider linking two CFJs if they inquire about
      the same or substantially similar events and are called at
      approximately the same time.
}}}

Amend the first paragraph of rule 2553 to read:
{{{
      If a CFJ about the effectiveness, possibility, or legality of a
      change in the gamestate has been assigned a judgement of
      PARADOXICAL continuously for between 7 and 90 days, then that
      case's initiator, CAN, by announcement, Transcend Logic,
      specifying that CFJ, provided that e has not already won the game
      with respect to that CFJ or to a CFJ linked to it. When a person
      transcends logic, e wins the game.
}}}
