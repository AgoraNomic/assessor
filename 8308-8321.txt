The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8308
Title: Imposing order on the order
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Falsifian
Co-authors: 


If Proposal 8291 has been passed, and Rule 2350 does not have the list
item "* A chamber to which the proposal shall be assigned upon it
creation.", add that list item to the end of the list. If the list
item is present, but it is not at the end of the list, or it is
unclear or otherwise difficult or impossible to determine where in the
list it is, put it at the end of the list.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8311
Title: Rewards Patch & Equitable Remedy
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: twg
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2496, "Rewards", by replacing "CAN once" with "CAN once by
announcement".

Amend Rule 2602, "Glitter", by replacing "CAN once" with "CAN once by
announcement".

For the purposes of this proposal, the "recession" is defined as the
period of time starting at 03:00 am UTC on 29th January 2020 and ending
the instant before the adoption of this proposal.

For each time a player met a reward condition during the recession,
grant that player the assets associated with the reward condition, or
if e is no longer a player, grant the same assets to the Lost and Found
Department.

For each time a player was awarded Glitter during the recession, grant
that player a quantity of coins determined in the manner specified by
Rule 2602, or if e is no longer a player, grant the same quantity to the
Lost and Found Department.

[This ensures no loss of coins, but shifts the responsibility for
 evaluating the missed rewards onto the Treasuror. Which is fair enough
 because it's mostly my fault. I say "mostly" because nobody else caught
 it in drafting either.]

Title: Finite Gifting
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2585, Birthday Gifts, by changing the text

  "Every time it is a player's Agoran Birthday, each of the other players
  CAN grant em 3 coins by announcement."

to read

  "Every time it is a player's Agoran Birthday, each of the other players
  CAN once grant em 3 coins by announcement."

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8317
Title: Zombie trade
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


[This proposal allows zombies to collect the fruits of their zombie
auctions, and to allow players to voluntarily enter servitude. Yes, it does
make buying a zombie a risky business!]

Amend Rule 2483 (Economics) by replacing "Agora, players, and contracts"
with "Agora, players, zombie trusts, and contracts".

Amend Rule 2532 (Zombies) by:
- appending "A player CAN, without 3 objections, flip eir own master switch
    to any other player. Other players SHOULD NOT object unless they believe
    that the intent is part of an attempt to flood Agora with the undead."
- inserting "- flip eir master switch;" in the list after the first item
- replacing "A zombie's master CAN flip that zombie's master switch to
    Agora by announcement." with "A zombie's master CAN flip that zombie's
    master switch to Agora or to any player who does not own any zombies by
    announcement."; and
- replacing "resale value" with "integrity".

Amend Rule 2574 (Zombie Life Cycle) by:
- replacing the first two paragraphs with: {
  Any player CAN, with notice, putrefy player who has not made a public
  announcement in the past 60 days. When a player is putrefied:
    - if e is not a zombie, eir master switch is flipped to Agora; and then
    - eir integrity is set to 2.

  Integrity is a secured switch for zombies, tracked by the Registrar, with
  possible values of the natural numbers and "well-maintained" (default). If
  an integrity switch would be modified in a manner that assumes it is
  already a number, such as to increase or decrease it, such a modification
  leaves "well-maintained" as-is. Whenever a zombie's master switch is
  flipped from Agora to a player other than emself, eir integrity is
  decreased by 1. At the end of a zombie auction, every zombie that is an
  excess lot in that auction has eir integrity decreased by 1.
};
- inserting "- if a zombie is master to another zombie, flipping the second
    zombie's master switch to Agora;" after the second item in the list; and
- replacing "resale value" with "integrity" throughout the rule.

Amend Rule 1885 (Zombie Auctions) by:
- replacing "resale value" with "integrity";
- appending "When the winner of a zombie auction pays Agora to fulfill eir
    obligation to satisfy eir bid, the coins so transferred are immediately
    transferred into trust for the zombie."

Create a new power-2 Rule entitled "Zombie Trusts":
{
  Each zombie has a zombie trust, an entity referred to as the "<zombie name>
  Trust". To place assets "in trust" to a zombie is to transfer those assets
  to that zombie's trust, and similarly for other similar language.

  When an active player becomes a zombie, all of eir coins are transferred
  into eir zombie trust unless e flipped eir master switch emself and
  specified otherwise in the same message. Whenever a zombie becomes active,
  all coins held in trust for em are transferred to em immediately before eir
  trust ceases to exist.

ID: 8318
Title: Notorial Economy
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


If the Notary's Interest is the empty set, change it to [Economy].

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8319
Title: Sergeant-at-Arms
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


Amend the rule entitled "Ministries" by changing the text
"Interest is an office switch" to read "Interest is secured office switch".

Amend the rule entitled "Proposal Classes" by changing the text
"an untracked Class switch" to read "a secured untracked Class switch".

Amend the rule entitled "Proposal Chambers" by changing the text
"Chamber is an untracked ordinary proposal switch" to read
"Chamber is a secured untracked ordinary proposal switch".

[As is, a power 1 proposal can flip interest, giving a certain officer
infinite votes. This potentially allows for escalation of a power 1
dictatorship. The others are secured out of an abundance of caution.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8320
Title: Promotorial Assignment
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


Amend the rule entitled "Proposal Chambers" by adding the text
"If a proposal in the Proposal Pool has its chamber unset, the Promotor
CAN set the chamber to a specified ministry by announcement." at the beginning
of the last paragraph.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8321
Title: Untying Quorum
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 879, "Quorum", by deleting the text "(breaking ties upward)".

[This has been bothering me for ages; I added this, but ties are impossible
with a 2/3, so this is just confusing (and has lead to confusion on at
least one proposal).]
