ID: 9184
Title: Ratification fix
Adoption index: 3.2

Amend rule 1551 by changing
{{{
* The publication time is the instant at which the document to be
  ratified was published.
}}}
to
{{{
* The publication time can be specified by the instrument allowing
  the ratification, defaulting to the instant at which the document
  to be ratified was published.
}}}

Amend rule 2201 by changing
{{{
- If the rules define it as a self-ratifying attestation to a
  given statement, the statement is ratified.
}}}
to
{{{
- If the rules define it as a self-ratifying attestation to a
  given statement, the statement is ratified, with the publication
  time being the instant at which the document was published.
}}}

[This has been broken for a while, and was observed to be broken a
while ago: self-ratifying attestations, such as proposal results,
currently don't usually self-ratify because the definition of the
publication time doesn't work for them unless the statement being
attested to is explicitly published.

If this proposal is adopted, I encourage the Assessor to explicitly
publish the statement being attested to as part of the resolution
message, in order to ensure that those results self-ratify.]

Amend Rule 2692 ("Bang!") by replacing "When a player stands alone, e
wins the game. If a player won the game in this manner 4 days ago, then
the match state is flipped to none (if it is not already)." with the
following: "When a player stands alone, eir radiance is increased by 30,
then the match state is flipped to none (if it is not already).".

[A full win for this relatively fast (even after the changes) subgame
has always seemed like a lot to me.]
