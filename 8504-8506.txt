The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8504
Title: easier bargains
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2627 (The General Store) by replacing:
      a list of 6 or more rules-defined card types
with:
      a list of 4 or more rules-defined card types with at least
      two of the types being different

[Commentary: make bargains easier, but ensure they're not identical
(double-rewards) for base trades.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8505
Title: Card clarifications
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2624 as follows:

  - Replace "The type of card with the fewest existing instances" with
    "The single type of card with the fewest existing instances (if any)"

  - Replace all instances of "the card's associated ministry" with "a
    ministry associated with the card".

[Right now the text assumes that each type of card has only a single
associated ministry, but this is not true because of the recent change
for the Ministry of Economy. There's also ambiguity with what happens if
multiple types of card are tied for fewest instances.]
