[The intent here is the order folks fire rounds in a given week
shouldn't matter -- essentially everyone shoots simultaneously. That
way, there's no incentive to schedule things around midnight Monday.]

Amend rule 2692 (Bang!) by replacing "a single player is alive" with "a
single player was alive at the beginning of the week"

Amend rule 2696 (Bang actions) by replacing the paragraph reading:

       When a player (the shooter) fires a round, sequentially for each
       person (the target) in the target list, if the shooter is alive
       and has at least two bangs, and the target is an alive player,
       then two of the shooter's bangs are destroyed, after which the
       target is eliminated.

with:

       When a player (the shooter) fires a round, sequentially for each
       person (the target) in the target list, if the shooter has at
       least two bangs and was alive at the beginning of the week, and
       the target was an alive player at the beginning of the week, then
       two of the shooter's bangs are destroyed, after which the target
       is eliminated.

[Makes the ongoing->none transition non-automatic and adds
initializing->none as a possible transition. In addition, clarifies that
non-players can get eliminated but nothing happens to em.]

Amend rule 2696 (Bang actions) by 1) replacing the paragraph reading:

       When a player is eliminated, if eir vitality is alive, then the
       following happen in order:
       * Eir vitality is flipped to unalive.
       * E gains one bang.

with:

       When a person is eliminated, if e is an alive player then the
       following happen in order:
       * Eir vitality is flipped to unalive.
       * E gains one bang.

2) replacing the paragraph reading:

       If the match state is ongoing and has not changed in the past 7
       days, and if no player has loaded a round or fired a round in this
       Agoran week or the previous two Agoran weeks, then the match state
       becomes none.

with:

       If the match state is ongoing and has not changed in the past 7
       days, and if no player has loaded a round or fired a round in this
       Agoran week or the previous two Agoran weeks, then any player CAN
       flip the match state to none by announcement.

and 3) adding the following paragraph at the end of the rule:

       If the match state is initializing and has not changed in the
       past 28 days, then any player CAN flip the match state to none by
       announcement.
