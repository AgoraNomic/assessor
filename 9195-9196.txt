[This is a useful but under-utilized mechanism; hopefully these tweaks
make it easier to build on.]

Amend rule 2681 (Acting on Commitment) by replacing:

       Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
       commitment" to a particular kind of document, that person performs
       that action by performing it by announcement while, in the same
       message, also publishing a what is purportedly a Fingerprint for a
       document of that kind.

with:

       A person CAN make a commitment to a particular kind of document
       by publishing a statement that purports to be a Fingerprint for a
       document of that kind. If the statement is in fact such a
       Fingerprint, the person CAN then reveal the commitment by
       publishing the Plaintext corresponding to that Fingerprint and
       clearly indicating which Fingerprint the Plaintext relates to.

       A person making a commitment SHOULD specify the method used to
       produce the Fingerprint from the Plaintext.

Amend Rule 2690 (Spendies) by appending this text to the paragraph
containing "Spendies are tracked by the Spendor":

       If the Spendor's report is overdue, then other players SHOULD
       deputise to publish it.
