//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8215
Title: recusal simplification
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: G.
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 591 (Delivering Judgements) by deleting the following text:
  If e does not, the Arbitor CAN remove em from being the judge of that
  case by announcement, and SHALL do so in a timely fashion after the time
  limit expires, unless the judge assigns a valid judgement in the
  mean time.


Amend Rule 2492 (Recusal) to read in full:

  A judge CAN recuse emself from a CFJ e is assigned to, by
  announcement.

  The Arbitor CAN recuse a judge from a case by announcement, if that
  judge has violated a time limit for judging the case and has not
  judged it in the mean time; the Arbitor SHALL do so in a timely
  fashion after the time limit expires, if able.

  If a judge is recused from a case 4+ days after being assigned
  to it, e SHOULD NOT be assigned as a judge until e has apologised
  and or reasonably explained eir actions.


[
- General rewording goes from 12 to 9 lines of text; net -3 lines in
the ruleset.

- It was weird that recusing oneself from a CFJ made one ineligible
to judge for a week, but being recused for lateness didn't.  There
are also honorable reasons to self-recuse (e.g. self-interest in the
case).  Changed this to the idea of "if you're recused in any way after
being assigned 4+ days, let us know why, before getting another case",
and only governed by a SHOULD.  It's as much about helping the Arbitor
figure out if the recused are still interested in judging.

Amend Rule 2555 (Blots) by replacing:
  If a player has neither gained blots nor expunged any blots from
  emself in the current Agoran week, e CAN expunge 1 blot from

with:
  If a person (the penitent) has neither gained blots nor had
  more than 2 blots expunged from emself in the current Agoran
  week, then any player (the confessor) who has not expunged
  any blots in the current Agoran week CAN expunge 1 blot from the
  penitent, by announcement.
