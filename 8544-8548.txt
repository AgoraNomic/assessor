without a method or is otherwise used incorrectly. For instance,
all caps CAN is used in a bunch of places where its narrow, technical
meaning doesn't quite seem to apply.]

  whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes is
  reasonably close to that required by the Rules, and for which the
  final choice is not trivially predictable by the selecting person
  in advance.

  set so long as the value chosen by the Treasuror is not obviously
  and grossly incorrect. The Treasuror CAN and MAY set the Total
  Buoyancy more than once a month, but SHOULD NOT do so unless there
  is reason to believe eir previous setting of the value failed.
