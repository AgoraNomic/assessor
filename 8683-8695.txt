Amend Rule 2585 (Birthday Gifts) by replacing:

      During a player's Agoran Birthday and the 7 days following, each
      other player CAN once grant em X boatloads of coins by
      announcement, where X is 3 if it is actually the day of the
      player's birthday, and 2 otherwise.

with:

      During a player's Agoran Birthday and the 7 days following, each
      other player CAN once acknowledge that person's birthday by
      announcement.  Doing so grants the birthday player 3 boatloads of
      coins if it is actually the day of the player's birthday, and 2
      otherwise.
