The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8607
Title: Asset Self-Ratification Fix
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Telna
Co-authors: ais523, Alexis


In Rule 2166 "Assets", replace the text "This portion of that entity's
report is self-ratifying." with the following:

  A public document purporting to be this portion of that entity's report
  is self-ratifying.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8609
Title: Axiom of Limitations
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2553 by, as a single amendment, replacing "CAN, by
announcement, Transcend Logic," with "CAN, by announcement, Transcend
Logic, specifying that CFJ," and replacing "for at least 7 days" with
"for between 7 and 90 days".

[Requires that people Transcending Logic specify which case they are
claiming the win for, ensuring that the "with respect to that CFJ"
clause actually functions. Also adds a time limit to claim to prevent
shenanigans and limit the scope of any bugs.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8610
Title: No Immediate Shenanigans
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2478 by appending the following to the paragraph beginning
"Initiating a Finger pointing found to be Shenanigans is ILLEGAL": "The
investigator of a finger pointing SHALL NOT point eir finger for the
Crime of Unjustified Gesticulation with respect to that finger pointing.".

[Prohibits the Referee from ruling Shenanigans, then immediately
pointing eir finger at the first pointer in order to get ahead on the
finger pointing contest.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8612
Title: Tournament Conclusion Fixes v2
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: G., Oerjan


Amend Rule 2464, Tournaments, by replacing:

{

  If a winner of a tournament is determined within within 3 months of its
  initiation, that person or persons win the game, otherwise the
  tournament concludes with no winner.

}

with:

{

  Each time that one or more winners of a tournament are determined before
  it concludes, that person or those persons win the game. A tournament
  concludes when its regulations state that it concludes. Additionally, if
  it has not previously concluded, a tournament concludes 3 months after its
  initiation.

}


All ongoing tournaments hereby conclude with no (further) winner, except
for the tournament initiated on or about 2 July 2021 (if it is still
ongoing).


[Ensures that any previous ongoing tournaments that found a winner are
concluded (which the rule did not explicitly state).]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8613
Title: The Name of the Win Cards v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Trigon


In ascending numerical order, amend each enacted rule by
case-insensitively replacing, as a single amendment per Rule:

* "Victory Card" with "Win Card"

* "Victory Point" with "Winsome"

* "Extra Vote" with "Votive"


Win Card balances are hereby set to what Victory Card balances were at
the time immediately before this proposal began taking effect.

Winsome balances are hereby set to what Victory Point balances were at
the time immediately before this proposal began taking effect.

Votive balances are hereby set to what Extra Vote balances were at the
time immediately before this proposal began taking effect.

[This introduces more whimsy into the asset names and means that Voting
Card and Victory Card are no longer both VCs.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8614
Title: Simultaneity Security
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 478 by, as a single amendment, inserting a paragraph break
before "Any action performed by sending a message", then appending to
the (new) final paragraph: "Allowing actions performed by sending a
message to take place simultaneously must be done explicitly and is
secured at power 2."

[This prohibits simultaneity without an authorizing rule, which is less
extreme than a total ban (which G. has exposed disapproval of).]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8615
Title: Supporter/Objector clarification v2
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2124 by replacing the following:

{

  The above notwithstanding, if an action is to be performed without
  N objections or with N Agoran consent, and an objection to an
  intent to perform it has been withdrawn within the past 24 hours,
  then Agora is not Satisfied with that intent.

  The above notwithstanding, Agora is not satisfied with an intent
  if the Speaker has objected to it in the last 48 hours.

  A person CANNOT support or object to an announcement of intent
  before the intent is announced, or after e has withdrawn the same
  type of response.

}

with the following:

{

  The above notwithstanding, if an action is to be performed without N
  objections or with N Agoran consent, and an entity has ceased to be an
  Objector to that intent within the past 24 hours, then Agora is not
  Satisfied with that intent.

  The above notwithstanding, Agora is not Satisfied with an intent if the
  Speaker has become an Objector to it in the last 48 hours.

  An entity is not considered a Supporter or Objector to an intent solely
  due to a purported support or objection made before the intent was
  announced. An entity is not considered a Supporter to an intent if e has
  previously ceased to be a Supporter to it, and e is not considered an
  Objector to an intent if e has previously ceased to be an Objector to it.

}

[

  In each paragraph, use Objector/Supportor status instead of evaluating
  whether objections were withdrawn. For instance, it has been previously
  pointed out (in private conversation) that the Speaker could potentially
  completely block an intent by objecting multiple times. Additionally, in
  the third paragraph, extend the restrictions to entities instead of just
  persons (since the definition of Supporter/Objector applies to entities,
  rather than persons).

  Fixes the bug in the previous version where ever withdrawing an
  objection would prevent you from ever objecting again.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8617
Title: Forgiveness
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: nix
Co-authors: G.


Agora formally forgives all fugitives listed on the most recent scroll
of Agora.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8618
Title: Solo Acitivity
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: nix
Co-authors: Janet


Amend R2646, "Activity" by by replacing:

  A player CAN activate or deactivate emself by announcement.

with:

  A player CAN, acting as emself, activate or deactivate emself by
  announcement.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8621
Title: Proposal spreading
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: R. Lee
Co-authors: 


At the end of paragraph four of the rule 1607 "Distribution", append the
following sentence
"If there are ten or more pending undistributed proposals in the proposal
pool, the promotor MAY refrain from distributing the most recently added 5
proposals if e distributes each other pending proposal in that Agoran week.
E SHALL then distribute those undistributed proposals the next Agoran week.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8623
Title: No prizeless victory auctions
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Trigon
Co-authors: 


[ COMMENT: After the reset, the poor player who still has the highest
   claim might be forced to pay for nothing; or, more realistically, the
   auction runner might just not be able to distribute lots for the
   auction. Either way, this is certainly not an ideal situation. ]

In Rule 2561 "VP Wins" replace the following:

  Four days after such a win occurs, all Cards and all Products are
  destroyed.

with:

  Four days after such a win occurs, all Cards and all Products are
  destroyed and any ongoing victory auctions end with no victors.

All victory auctions that were initiated before this proposal was
created end with no victors.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8628
Title: tacking into the win
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2638 (Player Focuses) by replacing:
  At the beginning of a month, every active player's
  Ministry Focus is set to the value e mostly recently specified by
  Planning to Flip. If a player did not Plan to Flip eir Ministry
  Focus switch in the last month, it is not flipped.
with:
  When the rules state that the winds change, every active
  player's Ministry Focus is set to the value e mostly recently
  specified by Planning to Flip. If a player did not Plan to Flip
  eir Ministry Focus switch since the last time the winds changed,
  it is not flipped.

  The winds change at the beginning of each month.


Amend Rule 2621 (VP Wins) by replacing:
  Then, each active player gains 1 card of each type and eir grant
  (if any).
with:
  Then, the winds change, following which each active player
  gains 1 card of each type and eir grant (if any).

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8629
Title: Independence Day
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: Gaelan, Telna, nix, Madrid, cuddlybanana, Janet


[Note: this proposal was not rushed, it was originally part of survivor
golf, and then substantially honed on discord.  Doesn't mean it should be
thoroughly checked! Also, please see the note at the bottom.]


Amend Rule 1728 (Dependent Action Methods) by changing its title to
"Tabled Actions" and amending its text to:

  An action is a Tabled Action if it is performed with one of the
  following methods:
  * With N Support, where N is a positive integer.
  * Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer.
  * With N Agoran Consent, where N is a positive integer multiple of
    0.1.
  * With T notice, where T is a time period.

  The parameters N and T, if omitted, default to 1 and 4 days,
  respectively (e.g. "without objection" means N=1). If a rule defines
  N as less than 1 or greater than 8, it is instead treated as 1 or 8,
  respectively.

  A person CAN act on eir own behalf, by announcement, to table an
  intent (syn. "intend") to perform a tabled action, conspicuously and
  without obfuscation specifying the action, the method (including non-
  default parameter values), and optionally, conditions.

  A person is the sponsor of such an intent if e tabled it, or if e is
  authorized to perform its action due to holding a rule-defined
  position previously held by the person who tabled it.


Amend Rule 2124 (Agoran Satisfaction) by changing its title to
"Performing Tabled Actions" and amending its text to:

  For a given tabled intent, a player CAN, unless otherwise forbidden by
  the rules or the document enabling the action, act on eir own behalf,
  by announcement, to:
  * Become a supporter ("support" it), unless e tabled or previously
    supported it;
  * Become an objector ("object to" it), unless e previously
    objected to it;
  * Cease to be a supporter or objector ("withdraw" support/objection).

  An intent is ripe if was tabled within the past 14 days, the Speaker
  hasn't objected to it in the past 48 hours, and its conditions, if
  any, are met.

  An intent is mature if it was tabled at least 4 days ago and nobody
  withdrew objections from it in the past 24 hours.

  A rule purporting to allow a person to perform a tabled action allows
  em to do so by announcement, if, considering only intents for that
  action/method combination:
  * With N Support: e is a sponsor or supporter of a ripe intent with
    at least N supporters.
  * Without N Objections: e is a sponsor of a mature ripe intent with
    less than N objectors.
  * With N Agoran Consent: e is a sponsor or supporter of a mature
    ripe intent with supporters greater than N times its objectors
    (e SHOULD list supporters and objectors).
  * With T notice: e is the sponsor of a ripe intent created at
    least T ago.


Repeal Rule 2595 (Performing a Dependent Action).


Amend Rule 2481 (Festival Restrictions) by replacing:
  1. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, non-Festive players are
     not eligible to support a dependent action;
with:
  1. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, non-Festive players
     CANNOT support/be a supporter for tabled action intents;


If the effects of a proposal authored by R. Lee have amended Rule 2124
in the previous 14 days, then amend Rule 2124 by deleting:
  "on eir own behalf,"

[On this final clause: this proposal is meant to keep all actual mechanics
of dep. actions unchanged.  I didn't want to take a particular position on
whether you can act-on-behalf of someone to support/object to an intent.
Unfortunately, it's unclear what the current rules allow.  By clarifying
in either direction, I'm taking a side.  But R. Lee has submitted a
proposal called "Allow acting on behalf to support or object".  The clause
