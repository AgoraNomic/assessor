//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8373
Title: Auction resolution fixes
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Jason
Co-authors: Aris


Amend Rule 2551 by replacing the text from "A person's priority on an
Auction is their" to "the excess lots are not won by any person."
(including both ends) with the following paragraphs:

  The bidders in an Auction are the players who have a non-withdrawn
  bid in that Auction. Priority is a strict total ordering over the
  bidders in an Auction. For two bidders with different bid amounts on
  their non-withdrawn bids, the bidder with the higher bid has higher
  priority than the other bidder; otherwise, the bidder whose
  non-withdrawn bid was placed earlier has higher priority than the
  other bidder.

  Upon the end of an Auction, for each lot, in the order they are to
  be awarded, the bidder with the highest priority in the Auction who
  is not yet the winner of a lot becomes the winner of the lot. If
  there are more lots than there are persons with non-withdrawn bids,
  the excess lots are not won by any person.

Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Alexis
Co-authors: 


Revoke the Patent titles "Prince of Agora" and "Princess of Andorra" from
Alexis, and award em the Patent titles "Prince of Andorra" and "Princess of
Agora".

[At some point, these appear to have been swapped in Herald's reports.
Since the report was ratified since the mistake was made, a proposal is
necessary to fix them.]
