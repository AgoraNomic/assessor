The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8357
Title: Homework extension fail
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: G.
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2327 (Read the Ruleset Week) by deleting the second paragraph.

[For reference, it's the "... in the year 2020, Read the Ruleset Week is,
instead, the week of February 24 - March 1" paragraph].

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8358
Title: No zombie blot creation v2
Adoption index: 2.0
Author: Janet
Co-authors: Alexis


Amend Rule 2532 (Zombies) by inserting the following list item before
the item that says "deregister.":

    - create blots;

Expunge each blot that a zombie's master caused that zombie to create.

[First attempt was ineffective due to typo in "self-punishment"
proposal. Masters should not be able to hurt their zombies in this way.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8360
Title: Social Distancing
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Alexis
Co-authors: 


Enact a new power-3.01 rule entitled "Eclipse Light", reading as follows:
{{
  An emergency message is one whose subject line contains the text
"[Emergency]".

  The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 3 Agoran
  consent, enact, amend, or repeal Emergency Regulations, provided that
  the intent to do so was also contained in an emergency message.

  Emergency Regulations CAN:
    - Extend any deadline provided for by any instrument other than this
  rule, including a deadline for an obligation to be met, or deadline
  prior to which an action must be performed in order to be valid, such
  as the end of voting period. Such an extension CANNOT cause the total
  time period, such as the time from when an obligation was created to
  the deadline or the whole of a voting period, to be more than double
  its original length.
    - Create, destroy, or transfer assets, or require or forbid their
  creation, destruction, or transfer.
    - Cause one or more players to win Agora.
    - Appoint or remove officeholders.
    - Modify the Festivity.
    - Award Patent Titles not mentioned in any Rule and Badges.
    - Modify the Publicity of Fora.

  The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 4 Agoran
  Consent, provided that the intent to do so was also contained in an
  emergency message, Extend the Emergency.

  If the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in the past
  month, any player CAN cause this rule to repeal all Emergency
  Regulations and then itself.

  If the Prime Minister has not sent a message to a public forum in the
  preceding four days, the Speaker CAN exercise eir powers under this
  rule as if e were the Prime Minister, and notwithstanding any rule
  that would prohibit a single player from holding both offices.
}}

[I don't think we actually need an emergency rule. But deadline
extensions might be nice, and I figure a little bit of levity might
help us all.]

[Knowing us, we will manage to not only pass it too late, but also too soon.]

ID: 8361
Title: Fix Emergencies
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: Alexis


Amend the rule entitled "Eclipse Light" by changing the text
  "If the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in the past
  month, any player CAN cause this rule to repeal all Emergency
  Regulations and then itself."
to read
  "If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least a month
  and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in the past month, any
  player CAN, by announcement, cause this rule to repeal all Emergency
  Regulations and then itself."

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


Amend the rule entitled "Eclipse Light" by deleting the text "and then itself".

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8363
Title: Somebody gets a coin
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Warrigal
Co-authors: 


Enact a power-1 rule titled "A Coin Award":
  {
      When this rule is enacted, a player other than the
      author of the proposal which enacted this rule earns 1
      coin. Then, if a player earned a coin this way, this
      rule repeals itself.
  }

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8364
Title: Mint Regulations
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2166, "Assets", by changing the text "A rule defined asset is
public" to read "An asset defined by rule or regulation is public".

Amend Rule 2464, "Tournaments", by appending the text
  "A Tournament's regulations collectively have Mint Authority.".

If there is a Rule entitled "Eclipse Light", amend it by adding, after
the list item beginning "Create, destroy, or transfer assets", a new
list item in the same format as the rest of the list with the text
"Collectively, exercise Mint Authority"

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8365
Title: Emergency Termination Notice
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Aris
Co-authors: 


[This gives everyone a bit of warning before someone goes and repeals the
Emergency Regulations, and gives the PM time to potentially extend
the emergency. Note that explicitly specifying the deadline in this rule
means that it can't be extended further.]

Amend the rule entitled "Eclipse Light" by changing the text
  "If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least a month
  and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in the past month, any
  player CAN, by announcement, cause this rule to repeal all Emergency
  Regulations and then itself."
to read
  "If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least a month
  and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in the past month, any
  player CAN, with 7 days notice, cause this rule to repeal all Emergency
  Regulations and then itself."
